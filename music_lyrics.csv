[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah

[Chorus]
Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain


[Refrain]
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

[Bridge]
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah
[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame


[Chorus]
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
(You're not the only one, you're not the only one)
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody"

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
""What's going on?""

And I say, hey-ey-ey

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Woah, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
(*Whistling*)

[Verse 2]
The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers?
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

[Chorus]
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (Dream away)
In the wind of change
Mmm


[Verse 3]
Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me (Take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (A glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (Share their dreams)
With you and me (With you and me)

On a glory night (A glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (Dream away)

Blows straight into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say (Say)

Take me (Take me) to the magic of the moment

[Verse 1: David Paich]
I hear the drums echoin' tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waitin' there for you""

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: David Paich]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become


[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do

Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet

Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds till we take to the street

You see, I've always been a fighter, but without you, I give up

And I love you

Now your pictures that you left behind are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry, one that made you have to say goodbye

When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he says the words you've been needin' to hear
I'll wish I was him, 'cause those words are mine

Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you, I'm still alright to smile

Was a time when I wasn't sure but you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now

You and I'll just use a little patience

I'm leaning sideways up against that far way wall
I've been chasing neon lights, but them lights ain't taking me

Whether it's life or death or in-between
But I've braved the wicked morning, barely waking down my sleeve

Matter of fact, I'm in the boat home
Floatin' down the river of drugs, paddlin' the cargo

I got a yard full of cans, more than you can rake
Bring a big black trash bag for the mess
After the party, have a maid clean up all the rest
I'm a continuous vibe, need no sleep
Have your bare feet hangin' out an old Jeep
You'll be wakin' up outside of the farm party
And I'll be gone like a dead body, yeah, shawty

The sandbox is thirsty
Outside, the bombs are bursting

[Verse 1]
See the children play in camo green
Mornin' tea, couple casualties
Merrily, merrily, merrily we all fall down
The smoky skies under power lines
The come-hither look in the bullseye
Pigtails, crosshairs
Don't be scared, it'll all be over soon

(Bang!) And the toy soldiers set sail
(Bang!) Even the bully knows war is hell
Where is the beauty in the madness?

The sandbox is thirsty
Outside, the bombs are bursting

Bang!
Bang!

See how they run in the hot, hot sun
Billy's got a slingshot, Jenny's got a cap gun
And the cannons cry, little Billy sucks his thumb
Don't cry, Billy, Jenny's just havin' fun

[Chorus]
(Bang!) And the toy soldiers set sail
(Bang!) Even the bully knows war is hell
Where is the beauty in the madness?
(Bang!) When all the battleships capsize
(Bang!) Look for the whites in their eyes
You crack a smile in the sadness

It was released in July 1983.[Verse 1]
I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream
And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose

[Verse 2]
And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try
And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game

But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it

[Verse 4]
Every time I see you, all the rays of the sun
Are all streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight
The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright
I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well it's nothing 'til I give it to you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone


[Verse 6]
But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

Maybe we could make this home
You should run away with me
Even if you're better off alone

[Verse 1]
I like that you like me
I kissed your lips, you got good taste
I like that you like me
I could close my eyes and draw your face
If you take this chance
I'll give you oxygen to breathe me in
But I'll say sorry in advance, mm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's a mess
It's like that every day and
I'll try my best
It sounds cliché, but

[Chorus]
Tell me, would you wait for me?
Baby, I'm a rolling stone
I got a lotta right in me
But I don't wanna say this wrong
Tell me, would you stay with me?
Maybe we could make this home
You should run away with me
Even if you're better off alone (Uh)


[Verse 2]
Your name is in neon light in the sky when darkness surrounds us
Let's leave this town, get married, go to Vegas and create nostalgia
Tell me, will you save this dance?
I feel my knees get weak beneath me
I know this night might be our last, mm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's a mess
It's like that every day and
I'll try my best
It sounds cliché, but

[Chorus]
Tell me, would you wait for me?
Baby, I'm a rolling stone
I got a lotta right in me
But I don't wanna say this wrong
Tell me, would you stay with me?

I'm all out of hope
One more bad break could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone to tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease, but hard to get release

[Chorus: Billy Idol & Perri Lister]
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace, your eyes without a face

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ch-ch

[Verse 2: Billy Idol]
I spent so much time
Believing all the lies to keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth for loving what was you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Billy Idol]
When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket, then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Ooh, the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down
Oh-oh-oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you and you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Billy Idol]
Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once so alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise


[Chorus: Billy Idol & Perri Lister]
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace, your eyes without a face

Such a human waste, your eyes without a face

Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

[Verse 2]
With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

[Verse 3]
Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take's on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true


[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend


[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

[Verse 1]
I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cat's in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

[Chorus]
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away

[Verse 2]
Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said

And I can't break away from this parade""
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

Crowded House - Don't Dream It's Over (Official Music Video),rock,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9gKyRmic20,Crowded House Don't Dream It's Over,"69 ContributorsDon’t Dream It’s Over Lyrics[Verse 1]
There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

[Verse 2]
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion, but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

[Instrumental Break]


[Verse 3]
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

[Outro]
Don't let them win
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Don't let them win
They come, they come
Don't let them win
Hey now, hey now (Yeah)
Hey now,  hey now"

[Verse 1]
Your cruel device
Your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

[Chorus]
I wanna love you, but I better not touch (Don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (Too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains

[Verse 2]
Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat

[Chorus]
I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (And pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you, but you're under my skin (Deep in)
I wanna kiss you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains

I want to love you, but I better not touch (Don't touch)

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die

[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

[Bridge]
That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings


[Verse 2]
You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

Desperate hearts, desperate hearts....

[Chorus]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathin' fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothin' I've ever
Seen before or will again


[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turnin'
As long as the stars are burnin'
As long as your dreams are comin' true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that

But I just won't do that

And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feelin'
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turnin'
As long as the fires are burnin'
As long as your prayers are comin' true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do that

Anything you've been dreamin' of

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that

But I'll never stop dreamin' of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Bridge: Lorraine Crosby, Meat Loaf]
Will you raise me up? Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me somethin' I can take home?
Now, I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now, I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwin' around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Outro]
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that"

Said, you took everything from me
Hey, yeah


[Verse 2]
Young at heart, and it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

[Pre-Chorus]
Still, talkin' to myself
And nobody's home, alone

[Chorus]
So nobody ever told us, baby
How it was gonna be
What'll happen to us, baby?
Guess we'll have to wait and see

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way, find another day
With all the changin' seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
And now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
Back down on the ground
And you don't talk so loud
And you don't walk so proud
Anymore and what for?


[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Well, I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own
And drifting all alone
If it doesn't show, give it time
To read between the lines

[Refrain]
'Cause I see the storm is getting closer
And the waves, they get so high
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through this time
Woah, this time
Without you

[Refrain]
I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die"

In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black, the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep

Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin', you just fade away

Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

In the burning heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire

[Verse 2]
In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says ""stop!"", his spirit cries ""never!""
Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

It was influenced by, among other things, Woody Guthrie and La Siesta del Martes.[Verse 1]
Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning
So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chrous]
It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow, I'm neither here nor there

[Verse 2]
Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded
I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just a-drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train


[Pre-Chorus]
And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow, I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane

Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Baby, don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each other's hands?
This time might be the last I fear
Unless I make it all too clear
I need you so, ohh

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong and make it right
Baby, it's all I know that you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole, I need you so

In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

[Verse 2]
The forces of evil and a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
Who's chokin' on the splinters


[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a madman
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

[Chorus]
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

[Verse 2]
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say


[Chorus]
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more (No)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
(Carry on) You will always remember
(Carry on) Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely Heaven waits for you

Lay your weary head to rest

Thinkin' of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too, but what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart

For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long, lonely nights

Does the feeling seem oh so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day

Was picked up by Smokey (=Smokie) in 1976 with much greater success.[Verse 1]
Sally called, when she got the word
She said ""I suppose you've heard
About Alice""
Well I rushed to the window, and I looked outside
But I could hardly believe my eyes
As a big limousine rolled up into Alice's drive

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice

[Chorus]
Twenty-four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice
(Who the Fuck is Alice?)

[Verse 2]
We grew up together, two kids in the park
Carved our initials deep in the bark
Me and Alice
Now she walks through the door with her head held high
Just for a moment I caught her eye
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice

[Chorus]
Twenty-four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice

[Verse 3]
Then Sally called back and asked how I felt
And she said ""I know how to help
Get over Alice""
She said ""Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here
You know I've been waitin' for twenty-four years""
And the big limousine disappeared

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice

[Chorus]
Twenty-four years just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance
But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice

[Verse 1]
These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

[Verse 2]
Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

[Bridge]
There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones


[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms

Well, it's Saturday night
You're all dressed up in blue
I been watching you a while
Maybe you been watching me, too
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well, if you're looking for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

[Verse 2]
Some girls, they want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe
On their arm, some girls
Like a sweet-talkin' Romeo
Well, round here, baby
I learned you get what you can get
So if you're rough enough for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

[Bridge]
The road is dark and it's a thin, thin line
But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time
Maybe your other boyfriends couldn't pass the test
Well, if you're rough and ready for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest


[Verse 3]
Well, it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two
Well, I don't know, baby
Maybe you've been around too
Well, there's another dance
All you gotta do is say yes
And if you're rough and ready for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

[Refrain]
If you're rough enough for love
Baby, I'm tougher than the rest"

Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win

You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night, or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 2]
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there


[Verse 3]
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around, and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Said the road less followed
'Here is the antidote,
For the lies you have swallowed.
It's not your fault,
Your instincts were diluted,
You were thinking from the Mainstream,
Which is deeply polluted.
The lies in this stream,
Will not keep you afloat,
Heavy untruths have been jammed
Down your throat.
Banksters, Media Hounds, Pharmaceutical lice
All swimming in lies
Screaming 'take my advice'
Backpaddle and see it,
For all that it's not,
This poison will blind you,
Free thoughts left to rot.
Turn off your tv,
Pull out the plug,
Stop reading the news,
Stop taking their drugs.
Pick up your book,
And rest your back on a tree
The world wide webs in nature
Will return you to simplicity'
A smart little cookie
Was this road travelled not,
A timely reminder
Of what logic forgot."

And she swear, ""Goddamn, If I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls!""

I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win
And a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the down side of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon, drank from the golden cup
Smoked the finest green
I stroked the baddest dimes
At least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart
You know where it ends
Yo, it usually depends
On where you start

[Verse 3]
I knew this kid named Max, he used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late, liked to get shit faced and keep pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gunfight and Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain
You know it comes that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game

God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose

And the message comin' from my eyes says, ""Leave it alone""
[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do

[Pre-Chorus]
And the feelin' comin' from my bones says, ""Find a home""
[Instrumental Chorus]


[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm goin' to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me and I will think no more

[Pre-Chorus]
And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, ""Go back home""

Well, my name's John Lee Pettimore
Same as my daddy and his daddy before
You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
He only come to town about twice a year
He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line
Everybody knew that he made moonshine
Now, the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
Headed up the holler with everything he had
Before my time, but I've been told
He never come back from Copperhead Road
[Verse 2]
Now, Daddy ran the whiskey in a big-block Dodge
Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
""Johnson County Sheriff"" painted on the side
He just shot a coat of primer, then he looked inside
Well, him and my uncle tore that engine down
I still remember that rumblin' sound
And then the Sheriff came around in the middle of the night
Heard Mama cryin', knew somethin' wasn't right
He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road

[Bridge]
Hey
Hey, hey


[Verse 3]
I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
They draft the white trash first 'round here, anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
I came home with a brand-new plan
I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico
I just plant it up a holler down Copperhead Road
And now the DEA's got a chopper in the air
I wake up screamin' like I'm back over there
I learned a thing or two from Charlie, don't you know?
You better stay away from Copperhead Road

[Outro]
Whoa
Copperhead Road

Ha, Copperhead Road"

OK, that's where I'm having trouble, because...
No, let's just do it once, because...
The problem that I'm having is that I'm so used to going all the way through and then starting by myself
Okay, so we do it once before you start singing?
The problem is that I'm just not used to hearing Pat do that one chord thing
One more time
(Oops)

[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
Made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
For all the millions here
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago


[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Who knows? Not me

And if you only hold me tight (If you love me)
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right (And we'll never)
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together, we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (All of the time)
I don't know what to do, I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)


[Post-Chorus]

But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do

Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?

Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball

In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova in the sky

A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye

In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday, you will find me caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova

That they're gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die

Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip

So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue

Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now

I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm lookin' out for angels
Just tryin' to find some peace

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't, just let me go

[Chorus]
'Cause teacher, there are things
That I don't wanna learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat


[Pre-Chorus]
That look in your eyes
Tellin' me no!
So you think that you love me
And know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

[Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I don't wanna learn
Oh, the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go!

[Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have
Is my pride
Oh, so I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just is unwillin' to try

I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try"

Can you remember, remember my name?
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Oh-oh-oh
And cold, cold spirits of ice, ah, ah
All my life
I am the echo of your past

[Verse 2]
I am returning the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Oh, oh-oh-oh
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day

[Chorus]
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain perfect strangers
[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah, no
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

[Verse 3]
A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind, oh-oh-oh
Is aching with the dead of the night
Oh-uh-oh, precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

[Chorus]
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain perfect strangers

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word, she can get what she came for
Ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

[Verse 2]
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Refrain]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts, I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Refrain]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder


[Verse 4]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-ho

[Verse 5]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Refrain]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, oh-oh

[Verse 6]
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? Oh


[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven"

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude the flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world


[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""


[Verse 3]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

[Verse 4]
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""


[Verse 5]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

[Verse 6]
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave""

Maybe together we can get somewhere

Maybe we'll make somethin'

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here

Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is

I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on drivin'

So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car

To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault


[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone"

Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
Ah, come to lovin'
She steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small

Never had a woman, never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things, doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bones
But you give it all you got
Weighin' in at nineteen stone

Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
And tryin' to forget you is just a waste of time

[Chorus]
Baby, come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby, come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you

[Verse 2]
All day long, I'm wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby, come back, oh, baby, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby, come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you, oh

Now that I put it all together, oh-oh
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me? Ain't there nothing left for me?

Baby, come back, oh, darling, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby, come back, listen, baby, you can blame it all on me

You've been doin' silly things like checkin' who I follow
I know you waitin' by the phone, but I just wanna be all alone tonight

It's like scars on my wrist when I think about the shit

Always chase their lies
Until you feel dead inside

Out of NJ
I wanna run away
Off to LA
I wanna run away
Off to Cali
I wanna run away

You couldn't fool me once if you tried
So goodbye

Everything godly
God himself is the only one could stop me
White chariot ablaze on the highway to hell
Feel the wrath carve your name on a shell

I will make you feel my pain
Kill em all
All these voices in my brain
Kill em all
Wild boy I can’t be tamed
I’m not to blame
I’m not the same
I’m full of rage

[Verse 1]
I’m so claustrophobic I cried inside the mri
You don’t understand how fast I’ll cut these fuckin ties
'Cause I don’t understand what being close feels like
I’m so numb I can’t feel none it’s like a poltergeist
My heart dark and frigid like a lonely night
Cause Don’t nobody fuck w me like I’m overpriced
I am dead but I’m alive
From the grave I had to rise
Wipe the teardrops from my eyes
No more pain got no more time
When you raised by wolves the darkness is your home
I befriended all my demons cause wouldn’t leave me alone
Rip my eyes eyes out wrap my head in a bandage
Blood on my face I’m the blind bat bandit


[Chorus]
Everything godly
God himself is the only one could stop me
White chariot ablaze on the highway to hell
Feel the wrath carve your name on a shell

I will make you feel my pain
Kill em all
All these voices in my brain
Kill em all
Wild boy I can’t be tamed
I’m not to blame
I’m not the same
I’m full of rage

[Verse 2]
KILL A RAT LIKE I BRUSH MY TEETH
KILL EM ALL TIL THEY ARE EXTINCT

RUN FROM THE PAIN LIKE A MARATHON
I WILL LIVE FOREVER LIKE IM NEVER GONE
PUT THE RED IN MY CUP LIKE IM SIPPIN BLOOD
WHY IS PAIN THE ONLY THING IVE EVER FELT FROM LOVE
Yes I will forgive you but I never will forget
Make the same mistake twice live a life of regret
Cut em off! - they fucking soft!
I paid the cost
Now I’m lost"

VBT und all die Fragen ""Wer hat besser gegoogelt?
Wer ist mein Gegner in der VR3? Deelah für Schwule
Ich mache deine Quali an und denke erst ""Jetzt kommt straighter Rap
Aber eine halbe Minute lang befummelst du dich erstmal selbst
Und du willst auf Fler machen, Boy
Kommt aber so als wärst du dick beschwipst nach einer Flasche Krombacher
Guck mal hier es ist das Opfer von der Straße
Ich schlage dir dein Veilchen und stopf dich in ne Vase
Es ist nicht nur erstaunlich wie schlecht sondern auch wie schwul du bist
Der einzige Wuppertaler der zu schlecht für Hip-Hop-Music ist
Aber Respekt man, denn um nen schlechten Beat zu picken
Bist du mal eben Weltrekordhalter im F5 drücken
Bringt dir dann trotzdem nichts, denn selber klingst du scheiße
Nennst dich ernsthaft Pipe, man, ich rauch dich in der Pfeife
Wieso bist du weiter? Woher kommen deine Glückspunkte?
Naila bei [?] man ich kenn schon deine Rückrunde
""Dima! Du warst bei Viva wie peinlich
Und du warst bei Feuer über Deutschland wie scheiße
Freestyle-Finale splash! find ich voll schäbig
RBA, Hall of Fame"" Halt die Fresse red nicht!
Google meine Videos! Nenne meinen Namen!
Doch deine beste Punchline ist ""Richman du bist arm!""
VBT wie immer, du zitierst den Shit von gestern
Während Ich mich frage ""Ey wer küsst SO seine Schwester?""
Meine Fans tragen Lacoste, spielen gern Lacrosse
Ich hol mir eine Nailgun schieße Naila in den Kopf
Während du versuchst hier ein wenig mitzurappen
Doch wer gegen Kash fliegt sollte nicht mit Richman battlen!


[Hook: Dima Richman]
Naila was los?
Zeig mal die Wuppertal-Flows!
Es ist erschreckend wie standard du bist!
Selbst für nen Standard-MC bist du zu standard du bitch!
Naila was los?
Zeig mal die Wuppertal-Flows!
Hör mal auf dein Dope zu rauchen
Die Leute sagen Ich ficke dich weg, geh mal Kondome kaufen!

[Part 2: Dima Richman & KASH]
Ich geh nicht einkaufen
Meine Wohnung sieht aus wie ein Scheißhaufen
Aber immer noch besser als dein Gesicht
Ich fick dich immer wieder als wärst du meine Bitch
Und weil das jetzt das zweite Mal ist
Denkst du, dass du mir nicht scheißegal bist
Aber weit gefehlt mir ist alles egal, kauft meine CD
Ich wär fast traurig, wenn nach 2 Jahren 40 Leute liken
Zumindest reden 9 darüber, auf meiner Seite!
Und es ist allen klar, dass du nicht so reich wie Dima bist
Aber echt so arm das du dein Essen auskotzt und dann wieder isst?
Bah! Find ich ja widerlich
Du wirst von mir zefickt und hoffst, dass es wahre Liebe ist
Battlerap bedeutet, das Dima Richman Sieger ist

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my God, it's a mirage
I'm telling y'all, it's sabotage

[Verse 2]
So, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothin'
You shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out, and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see, you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet

[Verse 4]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be? It's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage"

Eyes like a goat
Blinking sideways at the show
No shoes on, hooves for toes

Take me out to the back
I know, where you show me your hands
I don't, I don't wanna hold hands

Feed you through the picket fence
Bite my hand, drool, beg
Table manners, what a drag

I know, can I offer a drag?
I don't, I don't wanna hold hands

Tuck in my fist
Your watch off your favorite wrist
Check the time, get dressed
Blinkin' sideways at your guest

Look at the world in disbelief
You used to follow; now you lead
College has enlightened you
And you are proud to be different
And like different bands, different types
You ain't nobody's fool

[Bridge 1]
It's like certain bands remind you of someone you hated
Cause they didn't wear the right clothing
And there's only one true fashion
And a lot of the bands on the college charts are great bands
Until they get signеd; then you hate them
It's such bullshit
You usеd to love them, you hypocrite!

[Chorus]
Know it all
Know it all
Did you really listen to that song?
Could you ever write what you call wrong?

[Verse 2]
I remember you and I
Listening to bands that we liked
Only the songs mattered to you
But now you're a DJ and preaching that hype
""Corporate rock sucks,"" you know
""College radio enlightens you.""


[Bridge 2]
It's supposed to serve as a means to expose new bands without prejudice
But it makes no sense
""Safe Harbor for the Underground""
'Til the alternative becomes the popular sound
The bands are good 'til they make enough cash to eat food
And get a pad
Then ""they sold out"" and ""their music's cliche,""
Because talent's exclusive to bands without pay!

[Chorus]
Know it all
Know it all
Did you really listen to that song?
Could you ever write what you call wrong?
Know it all!

So when you gonna tell me what you're running from?

So let it begin

But now you're in the firing line and it's too late for us

But everything can change
Like finding comfort in the grave

Here comes a fix for the bleeding, to keep your souls breathing
If you're capsized, through the mist of years receding
Born from nothing, crawl from zero to none

Yes, I'm talking about dignity

Born from nothing, crawl from zero to none
Only evil reigns under the sun

VBT und all die Fragen ""Wer hat besser gegoogelt?
Wer ist mein Gegner in der VR3? Deelah für Schwule
Ich mache deine Quali an und denke erst ""Jetzt kommt straighter Rap
Aber eine halbe Minute lang befummelst du dich erstmal selbst
Und du willst auf Fler machen, Boy
Kommt aber so als wärst du dick beschwipst nach einer Flasche Krombacher
Guck mal hier es ist das Opfer von der Straße
Ich schlage dir dein Veilchen und stopf dich in ne Vase
Es ist nicht nur erstaunlich wie schlecht sondern auch wie schwul du bist
Der einzige Wuppertaler der zu schlecht für Hip-Hop-Music ist
Aber Respekt man, denn um nen schlechten Beat zu picken
Bist du mal eben Weltrekordhalter im F5 drücken
Bringt dir dann trotzdem nichts, denn selber klingst du scheiße
Nennst dich ernsthaft Pipe, man, ich rauch dich in der Pfeife
Wieso bist du weiter? Woher kommen deine Glückspunkte?
Naila bei [?] man ich kenn schon deine Rückrunde
""Dima! Du warst bei Viva wie peinlich
Und du warst bei Feuer über Deutschland wie scheiße
Freestyle-Finale splash! find ich voll schäbig
RBA, Hall of Fame"" Halt die Fresse red nicht!
Google meine Videos! Nenne meinen Namen!
Doch deine beste Punchline ist ""Richman du bist arm!""
VBT wie immer, du zitierst den Shit von gestern
Während Ich mich frage ""Ey wer küsst SO seine Schwester?""
Meine Fans tragen Lacoste, spielen gern Lacrosse
Ich hol mir eine Nailgun schieße Naila in den Kopf
Während du versuchst hier ein wenig mitzurappen
Doch wer gegen Kash fliegt sollte nicht mit Richman battlen!


[Hook: Dima Richman]
Naila was los?
Zeig mal die Wuppertal-Flows!
Es ist erschreckend wie standard du bist!
Selbst für nen Standard-MC bist du zu standard du bitch!
Naila was los?
Zeig mal die Wuppertal-Flows!
Hör mal auf dein Dope zu rauchen
Die Leute sagen Ich ficke dich weg, geh mal Kondome kaufen!

[Part 2: Dima Richman & KASH]
Ich geh nicht einkaufen
Meine Wohnung sieht aus wie ein Scheißhaufen
Aber immer noch besser als dein Gesicht
Ich fick dich immer wieder als wärst du meine Bitch
Und weil das jetzt das zweite Mal ist
Denkst du, dass du mir nicht scheißegal bist
Aber weit gefehlt mir ist alles egal, kauft meine CD
Ich wär fast traurig, wenn nach 2 Jahren 40 Leute liken
Zumindest reden 9 darüber, auf meiner Seite!
Und es ist allen klar, dass du nicht so reich wie Dima bist
Aber echt so arm das du dein Essen auskotzt und dann wieder isst?
Bah! Find ich ja widerlich
Du wirst von mir zefickt und hoffst, dass es wahre Liebe ist
Battlerap bedeutet, das Dima Richman Sieger ist
Weil Straßenrap für Schwule nicht wirklich eine Nische ist

[Chorus]
I need a temporary love
Could you be my temporary one?
Fall deep in your temporary touch
Oh, yeah
Give it everything I got, baby
Could you be mine?
All the stars and you look just like my sign
Ooh, yeah
Could you be mine?
Call me crazy, ain't that just what you like?

[Bridge]
Just maybe we could make it through
What would I, what would I know?
What would I, what would I know?
All you, baby, I'll pick up your tempo
What would I, what would I know?
What would I, what would I know?
Drop it

He like the way I turn 'em on
He love the way I turn around take control
And by the way you lay it down
Baby you so different, you should wear a crown

He love the way I turn around take control
But by the way you lay it down
Baby you so different, you should wear a crown

[Verse]
You know I know my place with you
No slick talk, ain't no playing games with you
Ain't it crazy things on hold for you lately
Not too much, touch my side on the daily
But, that's my baby
Love could save me
Make me crazy, fuck 'til I'm hazy
Can't stick 'round, return to sender
Chase no dick like a [?]
Hear it 'til you never wanna let go
Hold me down, but just for now
But when I hit you up in 3 months you better not let me hear that dial


[Chorus]
Temporary (Temporary)
Could you be my temporary one?
Fall deep in your temporary touch
Ooh, yeah
Give it everything I got baby
Give it everything I got baby
What would I, what would I know?
What would I, what would I know?

(Ahh!)
Temporary (Temporary)
Could you be my temporary one? (Should be mine)
Fall deep in your temporary touch
Ooh, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Give it everything I got baby

Temporary (Everywhere I go)
Could you be my temporary one? (Oh)
Fall deep in your temporary touch
Ooh, yeah
Give it everything I got baby

Nothing's forever, baby
It's all fleeting in the moments we experience
So loosen your grip, open your eyes, and remember
This too, shall pass"

Hawks game on the wood, my cup full of mud

Sometimes a gangsta need a hug

Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

I've been searchin' for love and found lust
It's so hard to stop holdin' a grudge

My whole squad kept the kid in the cut
Keep your strap 'cause these niggas play tough
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Keep it real, it's a lot of fake love
Niggas hate but they bitches in love
Paint the Bentley all white like a dove

Kicked her out, told her walk to the bus

You can't tell me that she ain't a slut

Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
Hawks game on the wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

[Verse 2]
I don't need no one vouchin' for me
I be flossin', ain't talkin' 'bout my teeth
Car push-start, I keep losin' the keys
Chanel, Boss my closet full of C's
My shit wet Eliantte, VVs
I got pearls 'round my neck, not no beads
I get cash in my bag while I'm sleep
New blue face, two-tone Patek Philippe
Beverly Center, shoppin' spree on me
New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't no one of my foreigns on E
All my bitches got expensive weave
I sip drank for my pain to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off the top for a breeze


[Chorus]
Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
Hawks game on the wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love"

Walkin' down the road
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here, Joe?
Some people say this town don't look good in snow
You don't care, I know

Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer
The nights are stronger than moonshine
You're gonna go

'Cause a free wind is blowing through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there
Seasons crying, no despair
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air

Sorry boy, but I've been hit by purple rain
Aw, come on, Joe
You can always change your name
Thanks a lot, son, just the same

And I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you

Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways

""Why won't you ever know

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream

[Verse 3]
Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moved my lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven"

Never would I take somethin' from my dog, not even a slice of pizza (Never)
And I never cross the G code, I'm the one that's tryna feed you (G code)
And they shake your hand 'fore they take you out, that's how shooters greet you (Hrrt)
Young niggas thirsty, they on a mission and they tryna eat you

We never go for that woofin' shit, that's how they niggas died (Niggas died)
Went on a mission, not payin' attention how my hitter died (Ayy)
I was a young nigga, but I spin the block soon as my cousin died (Ayy)

I gotta make it home, so I keep my pistol in the ride
Y'all niggas bitches, I don't believe niggas 'cause they tellin' lies (Tellin' lies)
I kept it real as fuck, but they fake, so they can't recognize
All that rap shit televised (Televised)
Ain't gon' stop killin' all them fuck niggas 'til I'm satisfied (Gang, gang)
Got the Lord in me, when I get mad, got the devil eyes (On God)
Ain't gon' stop puttin' on for my guys because I love my guys (I swear to God)

Ich mache deine Quali an und denke erst ""Jetzt kommt straighter Rap
Aber eine halbe Minute lang befummelst du dich erstmal selbst
Und du willst auf Fler machen, Boy
Kommt aber so als wärst du dick beschwipst nach einer Flasche Krombacher
Guck mal hier es ist das Opfer von der Straße
Ich schlage dir dein Veilchen und stopf dich in ne Vase
Es ist nicht nur erstaunlich wie schlecht sondern auch wie schwul du bist
Der einzige Wuppertaler der zu schlecht für Hip-Hop-Music ist
Aber Respekt man, denn um nen schlechten Beat zu picken
Bist du mal eben Weltrekordhalter im F5 drücken
Bringt dir dann trotzdem nichts, denn selber klingst du scheiße
Nennst dich ernsthaft Pipe, man, ich rauch dich in der Pfeife
Wieso bist du weiter? Woher kommen deine Glückspunkte?
Naila bei [?] man ich kenn schon deine Rückrunde
""Dima! Du warst bei Viva wie peinlich
Und du warst bei Feuer über Deutschland wie scheiße
Freestyle-Finale splash! find ich voll schäbig

Google meine Videos! Nenne meinen Namen!
Doch deine beste Punchline ist ""Richman du bist arm!""

Während Ich mich frage ""Ey wer küsst SO seine Schwester?""

Ich hol mir eine Nailgun schieße Naila in den Kopf
Während du versuchst hier ein wenig mitzurappen
Doch wer gegen Kash fliegt sollte nicht mit Richman battlen!

Hör mal auf dein Dope zu rauchen
Die Leute sagen Ich ficke dich weg, geh mal Kondome kaufen!

[Part 2: Dima Richman & KASH]
Ich geh nicht einkaufen
Meine Wohnung sieht aus wie ein Scheißhaufen
Aber immer noch besser als dein Gesicht
Ich fick dich immer wieder als wärst du meine Bitch
Und weil das jetzt das zweite Mal ist
Denkst du, dass du mir nicht scheißegal bist
Aber weit gefehlt mir ist alles egal, kauft meine CD
Ich wär fast traurig, wenn nach 2 Jahren 40 Leute liken
Zumindest reden 9 darüber, auf meiner Seite!
Und es ist allen klar, dass du nicht so reich wie Dima bist
Aber echt so arm das du dein Essen auskotzt und dann wieder isst?
Bah! Find ich ja widerlich
Du wirst von mir zefickt und hoffst, dass es wahre Liebe ist
Battlerap bedeutet, das Dima Richman Sieger ist
Weil Straßenrap für Schwule nicht wirklich eine Nische ist

Every day I pray that all this pain will go away
I hold my faith and trust that God will lead the way
I know I'll make it through the storm and through the rain
And I won't break until I see a brighter day

[Chorus]
The pain never goes away (The pain never goes away)
I suppress these feelings in my chest, then they move up to my neck
And decapitate, I'm obsessed with time
I know I can't get it back, so when I catch my head
It's only half the wait, I smile on Saturdays
The weekend's when I strengthen and deactivate
And then Monday comеs around and I relive the samе
The cycle is a storm I chase, but I can't seem to catch the rain

[Verse 1]
It's war when I'm in the booth
Just me inside a room and this liquor always tells the truth
Got my phone inside my hand
But I turned of my notifications 'cause the sight of one can fuck around and chase my mood
I hit record
My life's melodic pain they've never heard before
They get addicted to that sound and then I make them more
And now I understand why they say when it rains it pours
Don't wanna live my life inside this cage, I'm stuck in a retro grave
As history repeats itself, I seclude myself and ask for space
I think I'm planted in the storm
But I can't catch the rain, cover up a master pain, I think I got a


[Chorus]
Pain never goes away (The pain never goes away)
I suppress these feelings in my chest, then they move up to my neck
And decapitate, I'm obsessed with time
I know I can't get it back, so when I catch my head
It's only half the wait, I smile on Saturdays
The weekend's when I strengthen and deactivate
And then Monday comes around and I relive the same
The cycle is a storm I chase, but I can't seem to catch the rain

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm having trouble getting used to me
'Cause I remember how it used to be
I meet new people every day and you see, usually
I don't know if they like me or they motherfuckin' using me
And that's why I'm just closed off and antisocial
In and out of conversations
I'm compensating, my music's my excuse to say I'm vocal
My greatest hits are my worst times compiled
I bottled up and shared to the world and that's what made 'em global
And that's the fucked up part
Popping prescriptions while giving vivid descriptions to people who clap and listen
While you stuck inside a prison, slave to the algorithm
Cope with the mechanisms like liquor and chasing women
But that's what they want, then you wake up and it's all over
Life is nothing but a vapor, once you blink, you're older
Your heart gets colder
They meddle in your mind, the systems you gave your whole lifetime implodes and starts to corrode
And you're looking over your shoulder
Thinking how you supposed to get through this life while being sober
You lose composure, get to drinking for the closure
Then you right back in the cycle where those motherfuckers want ya, say


[Chorus]
The pain never goes away (The pain never goes away)
I suppress these feelings in my chest, then they move up to my neck
And decapitate, I'm obsessed with time
I know I can't get it back, so when I catch my head
It's only half the wait, I smile on Saturdays
The weekend's when I strengthen and deactivate
And then Monday comes around and I relive the same
The cycle is a storm I chase, but I can't seem to catch the rain

[Outro]
Every day I pray that all this pain will go away (Dear God, please burn every bridge that brings my life back to pain)
I hold my faith trust that God will lead the way (Amen)
I know I'll make it through the storm and through the rain
And I won't break until I see a brighter day"

I just sent a care package down the way, I hope it make it
Told my baby mask up on the drill like he Jason
We ain't have enough for the whole load, we had to take it
Kidnap the plug, tie him up, put him in the basement
Watchin' cameras in the spot 'cause we paranoid
Know the raid comin' any minute, so we ready for it
We done beat the doors off this bitch, so we ain't trippin'
I done broke the damn jack tryna press a whole chicken
Where thе lean at? This a room full of custos
We tryna get a pint and takе turns on it like a busto
So many chops, thought we owned a gun store
Hundred shots on your block, that bitch smell like gun smoke

[Verse 2: Wizz Havinn]
Niggas never had no pape', ain't seen a honey-bun
Can't hit the store for this, nigga, customized one-of-one
Ain't finna box, hit a nigga with this Glock, fuck one-on-one
Wrist full of rocks, I walk around big knots and fully guns
I don't play no games, set up the play and get it done
Barely know her name, I fucked that ho just for the fun
Can't bring the banger in, then I just won't fuckin' perform
This shit cost a pretty penny I got sittin' on my arm
I spent over a twenty for my motherfuckin' charm
Still'll slide in a rental, but I got my own foreign
Yeah, long live my niggas, I been puttin' on for 'em
With my wrist, I do magic, I got my own form


[Verse 3: Talibando]
Yeah, I done been to war, seen the belly of the beast
Bodies haunt me late night, I can't even go to sleep
Sometimes I sit and overthink, so I get high 'til I can't think no more
Countin' money always calm my nerves until my fingers sore
Million dollars worth of game like Wallo
I tote big shells, niggas better tuck they taco
I need it all, stack it tall, I'm talkin' every dime
Black Carhartt, black Nike boots, I'm on the grind
I still got a run, I don't gotta rhyme
Cuddy down the way with a half a man and he out on bond
I'ma get this money if I don't do nothin' else
Bring the bag and work it, I ain't never needed help
My shirt and shoes from Italy, I even got the belt
You don't wanna be enemies, you end up gettin' killed
Smokin' strong's got me coughin' up my lungs, chillin' in the slums
The streets dried up, these niggas barely makin' crumbs
Niggas bums, they ain't got no funds, wanna have some fun?
Say it's on when you see me, shit, you better have your gun"

Come with that work for me
Four in the morning, yawning (Ba-ba)

Early in the morning, late into the evening

Early in the morning, late into the evening
And birds keep calling, keep on calling me

Have you ever tried and got denied?
Going to bed, waking up tired
Time after time, you on the grind
It get difficult, no lie
Yeah, Bread Winner, brick layer been my reflection
Bringing the load, I’ma win off the extra
I'm who they want, everything I do special
Get what you want if you from our section
Whip out the bowl, got a new 911
Invisible roof reappear in a second
First I was broke, now the Rollie a present
One four, twenty-three, ID rows on the bezel
They know I'm him, so they copy and edit
Nothing alike this irregular texture
Popular women consider me sexy
They cannot step in dimensions I'm flexing
Power behind me on this holy mountain
My name in the bible with all my disciples
Reborn again and I got a new title
Creator Almighty, I'm God, the Messiah
Cleansing my sins, started healing, I'm righteous
Free everybody who thugging in Rikers
Know that I'm free, I'm authentically me
See a hill with a tree, I pull over and hide

You be scared of the dark? Leave the lights on

Smell from the bridges, can't kill it with the Lysol
I hold it down on my own
I’ma get us out these trenches and we gon' be alright
Cheapest numbers in the city and the dope is alright
Big ol' eagle flipping chickens and the dope is alright

Started off dealing it hard, got my problem solved
Did what it take

Know that I'm him
Know that you know that I'm built, don't need no bodyguard

Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

Hmm
The biggest opp in America
Come on, man, you know what I stand on (The whoop way)
What you stand on, whoop?

[Verse 1]
Every time a nigga turn around, it's a problem (Uh)
So many niggas I showed love to, I should've robbed 'em (Should've robbed 'em)
Brodie bag ain't big as mines, but I got 'em (Got 'em)
I'm talkin' five thousand beans every week, this bitch rockin' (Whoop)

[Chorus]
All I chase is money, if you a hustler then you understand me (Yeah)
You see my face at a random place, that mean they payin' me (No cap)
Told Marc dog, it's time to go, pull the truck around (Let's go)
Bro jumped in and grabbed the Drac', then let the windows down (Oh)
I was fuckin' up, I blew two-hundred thousand a couple times (Couple times)
Now I'm locked in, only thing I see is dollar signs (Uh)
My young dog in Tennessee, runnin' through the yeas (Yeah)
You could shit the bed, send the loc', he pull up in the air (Bop, bop, bop)

[Verse 2]
Y'all are never there, ask me how I know 'cause I be everywhere (Okay)
I'm all across the world, my ape head cost two bricks of girl (Okay)
Me and B pulled up with the Jeep, with the sleeve on it (Sleeve on it)
This boogieman wipe a nigga nose, you better not sneeze on it (Achoo)
Brick of dog so motherfuckin' strong, it got fleas on it (Whoop)
Brodie in the kitchen, puttin' his paws and his feet on it (Yeah)
Do shit niggas brag about and don't speak on it (Lame ass nigga)
Whoop lease so motherfuckin' strong, I can't stop goin'
We goin' a hundred Ps, bring two-hundred Gs, I'ma stock
I'm on a moving candy, nigga, I don't move without the hammy (Yeah)
Bitch, sin season, instantly start comin' out her panties (Uh)
So for the streets, I might never make it to the Grammys (Uh)
Don't boo that, long as I put some Ms up for my family
Went to Booby Trap, now I got a high rise in Miami
It's too exact, I just had a threesome on a balcony (Ooh)
They like, ""Who is that?"" Limo tint wrapped around a Caddy (Ooh)


[Chorus]
All I chase is money, if you a hustler then you understand me
You see my face at a random place, that mean they payin' me
Told Marc dog, it's time to go, pull the truck around (Whoop)

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

[Verse 2]
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh


[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

I can teach you how to win, you niggas wrongdoing it
I stream better than that guy and my songs prove it
Actin' like they love you, when you leave, they got a lot to say
But I'ma get this shit by any means, stayin' out they face
I'm the G.O.A.T. and niggas know it
I'm really up some dog shit and I can show it
I just been bein' a little bit too humble, I'm finna ho niggas
And since you put it in the air, it's on the floor with it, nigga
I'm a man with my gun and without it, nigga
And if you take it to that place, I been had shot a nigga
You the type to tell it to that people, let the copper get it
I'm standin' on anything, fuck an opposition
I keep it real with everybody, nigga, ask around
My name been good way before I put that package down
I'm tired of all you fake niggas, you just fanned out
Won't catch me slipping, shit, I live my life planned out
But I'ma play it like a boss, nigga

Don't put me in that predicament, I bet I shake somethin'

I tried to be the nice guy, but it's beyond that
Okay, I'ma get it anyway, shit, I ain't trippin', nigga

Real-ass ghetto boy how they present a nigga
Shit, everything that happened made me, I don't regret it, nigga
We can go rack for rack, you wanna bet it, nigga
When I sold dope, I did it raw, I didn't stretch it, nigga
I can't lie, I ain't got no time for no extra niggas
We gon' ball on them niggas every chance we get
Turn the pressure up on niggas, got him saying, ""I quit""

Don't give a fuck, I like mean bitches
And niggas been dead, we ain't never

You got to be sharp when you move
How we move, niggas, like ""Fuck prison""

It might've been a nightmare

You with me

If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""


[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

Corrupts the Europeans
Behold the second act
In the saga of Imaginos

Armies of the past retreat
In the wake of revolution
A journey to the country
Of the fourth dimension
Spectacle of awakening light
The soldiers are baffled but still they fight

Creator, destroyer, victory, defeat
I did not come to bring us sleep
Black flag, red flag, space and time
The future is my mind

Judgement day falls on us
After the revolution
This trial of lifе will take us far
A limitless solution
Minus time of alchеmy
This mirror of power came to be

Creator, destroyer, victory, defeat
I did not come to bring us sleep
Black flag, red flag, space and time
The future is my
The future is my
The future is my
The future is my mind

[Strofa 1: Fares]
Tu hai
La faccia sporca di bugie
Io ho
La testa piena per capirle

[Pre-Ritornello: Fares]
Okay, sto aspettando un giorno nuovo
Sto uccidendo un sogno e basta
Sto smettendo, ma lei impara
Sto uscendo ancora di testa
Sto vestendo un Moncler nuovo
Punto in testa due pistole
Sto perdendo cose a caso

[Ritornello: Caph]
Ma per te resto fermo immobile
Ho visto noi due soli tra la polvere
Scappi tra le nuvole, ti vuoi nascondere
Non è solo sangue, non è solo un cuore

[Strofa 2: Faster]
Non è solo sangue, come in guerra, ah
Anche se la guerra la facciamo е non facciamo mai la pace
Siamo a terra, ah
Parlare con tе è come un monologo
Perché ho il cielo sotto i piedi ma l'asfalto in testa
Volevo l'amore, ma ho una lancia in petto
Cercavo il tuo nome sulla sabbia, ma noi sappiamo come cambia il vento
Ora il casino sta puntando su di me
Con i ""ma"" e con i ""però"" non si è mai concluso niente
E ritroverò il mio posto, posto
Anche se uno spazio per me non c'è stato mai
Sotto zero, prigioniero e non t'importa più, lo so


[Ritornello: Caph]
Ma per te resto fermo immobile
Ho visto noi due soli tra la polvere
Scappi tra le nuvole, ti vuoi nascondere
Non è solo sangue, non è solo un cuore"

[Intro: Farid Bang & Kollegah]
JBG, Mutterficker, die Crew, die dich wegbombte
Aus „Komm, lass paar Mütter ficken“ wurd 'ne Geschäftsbranche
Damals im Rap-Genre verkaufte niemand CDs
Wir kamen wie 'ne Armee und haben G-Rap geprägt
Wurden immer noch wie Wintersportler schief angeseh'n
JBG? Farid Bang? Boss, warum featurst du den?
Ich ließ die Kritiker steh'n, sie fanden den Rap niveaulos
Wir hab'n im Tagteam-Modus ihre Theorien widerlegt
Den Markt hier wiederbelebt
Mit JBG 2, Ergebnis harter Arbeit, uns wurd nix in die Wiege gelegt
Wir ging'n den widrigen Weg
Haben bei Beef die Kollegen in dieser Szene einfach übertrieben niedergemäht
Sind jetzt die Leader im Game
Hab'n keine Ferien gemacht, sondern Imperien geschaffen und mehr Bizeps denn je
Die Mios liegen im Safe, was für Riesenbudgets!
Bruder, was sind achtzigtausend für ein'n Videodreh? (Heh)
Mois, wenn ich ein Jahr meine Steuern nicht bezahl'
Reißt es Deutschland in 'ne Staatspleite und Krisen entsteh'n
Und selbst wenn mal ein Jahr ohne Releases vergeht
Haben wir Einnahmen am Ende wie ein Kirchengebet
Läuft bei dir, Bruder! Läuft bei dir, Bruder!
Bist du satt? Niemals! Guck, was aus Deutschrap wird, Bruder
Nur noch Biter, nur noch Fotzen, nur noch Krüppel im Business
Es wird Zeit! Für was? Wieder paar Mütter zu ficken


[Part 1: Kollegah]
Wir rattern wieder durch die Szene (Yeah), Presslufthammer-Style
JBG 3, Untergang des Trap-Newcomer-Hypes
Ihr rappt von Kokaina, macht auf Stoffverticker und Pimp
Das sind nur aufgesetzte Roll'n wie die Lockenwickler von RIN
Der Opfer fickende King, den ihr nicht featuren könnt
Der die Silben gezielt in die Beats stampft, dir dein'n Arm per Hieb abtrennt
Und während Laas sich wieder ma' Weed-Blunts am Fließband gönnt
Wirst du in Tempelhof rasiert wie'n Shaolin-Kampfmönch
Also was guckst du so? MOK, geh mir deine Mutter hol'n
Dein Tape gibt's nicht bei Amazon, sondern bei ArmerNuttensohn
Ich zieh' Butterflys und Laas kann nicht mal mehr geh'n
Denn der King sticht in die Sehn'n wie'n Schiffskapitän
Sick in the brain, Netflix und Chill mit der Braut von Sido
Rumfingern beim Filmgucken – Daumenkino
Sie will die Spermaspur'n kaschier'n und fragt mich: „Hast du Handtücher?“
Ne, aber da drüben steht Sun Diego, also Schwamm drüber (Yeah)
Was los? Ihr ganzen arschgefickten Stricher
Macht ja panische Gesichter wie Anime-Entwickler
Denn Teil drei setzt noch ein'n drauf, scheiß auf zeitgemäßen Sound
Wir bring'n Sound, damit pushst du dich vorm Thaibox-Training auf

[Part 2: Farid Bang]
Zugedröhnte Hurensöhne machen auf Kokaschmuggler
Doch geh'n heut total unter wie Royal Bunker (Hehe)
Die Letzten aus der Saiyajin-Familia (Familia)
Deine Kleine liebt den Dreier wie Shakira
Carolin Kebekus macht auch paar Witze
Doch wer dich Nutte fickt, ist zu faul zum Wichsen
Die Huso-Killers (Ey), meine Hublot glitzert (Ey)
Du siehst uns mit dicken Kettchen wie Sumoringer (Ey)
Und du meinst, du kriegst von Pablo Jobs
Doch ich krieg' von deiner Mutter paar Blowjobs (Hahaha)
Zu viele Rapper, die mir zu viel Kies verdienen
Auf den Nacken von Franzosen wie Guillotinen
Mach dir für deine lächerlichen Texte Skizzen
Ich mach' mir höchstens Stichpunkte beim Testospritzen
Ich will Rapper ficken, fick dein'n Künstlerstatus
Und wieso heißt du rückwärts Anus? (Ya kelb)
Euer Hype ist bald vorbei, ich versprech's diesen Acts
Bin wie Beşiktaş back und mach' Rap wieder Rap, ah
Stress mit uns war 'ne scheiß Idee
Ich hab' euch alle schon gefickt, nur noch einer fehlt


[Hook: Kollegah & Farid Bang]
Setz' die Krone ab und die Sturmmaske auf
Leg' das Zepter zur Seite und die Kugel im Lauf
Tausch' den Platz im Thron gegen den Sitz im Benz
JBG 3, Weg frei, klick, klick, bang
Eyo, der Stiernacken zu breit für die Sturmmaske
Eyo, der Stiernacken zu breit für die Sturmmaske
Bruder, bist du bereit? Bruder, ich bin bereit

You don't know what I've been through
Lost it all and my rent's due
Trouble, when it rains it floods
In my pain no it ain't all good
No but I tell them this
I'm a witness
That everything is made new
So tell em' dawg I ain't through
Feels like feels like this life just became a fight
Yeah I'm in it ain't no way out
I know the pressure's on me
Yeah the stress is on me
But tell em' who ain't gon' crack homie

OK life, for most, we know that this is not paradise
But we swear it's tight when she wear it right
I feel the heat it's Miami Vice
It's the rest in me to get the rest of me
You start burnin for that but ain't no turning me back
That's pressing me and they testing me
To see me fail and give me hell so I'd be burnin' in that
Yeah right, life is an island which means we trapped in that
But we cool cuz' the view so nice and lax
And like we don't feel the pain cuz' of laughing gas
But one blast of that and you'll forget that this pain is real
Yeah but no matter how good that feels
Man this pain is a thing that kills
Man I heard that so I swerve back
Curve that so let me curve back
Every time I feel that urge back
We crossing paths where we merge at
It drives me crazy but lately
Man I feel like I can't make it
Just last year I couldn't take it
In His strength man I can say this

Hold up
What you said? All that fame done gone to my head?
Like that same power that saved me
Can't raise me from the dead?
They get me reading thinking bout keepin' peace
While I'm raging war on myself
I'm feeling myself then I'm killing myself
I'm sipping on blood and I'm chewing on flesh
Just chill out we don't want to hear that mess
All that 'won't do that' or that 'can't do this'
Pain, death, hurt, hate we done been through this
And I'm sure there's plenty more that I ain't been through yet
But I don't care though, bring on the heavy metal
I got a power living in me that'll never settle
Never leave nor forsake I'm a bleed never break
I'm a die come back with the keys to the safe
Gotta keep sitting deep for the things that I face
Can't erase God's ink wait clean with the paint
And I'm stained in it when the pain hit me
I withstand anything that you bring to me

I take time out, I got warriors on my bench, Chris Paul
Whenever I'm triggered, my trigger finger itch more (Uh-huh)
Reach in my pocket, I can pull hundreds out by the fistful, look (Yeah)
Ain't nobody put me on, I think y'all took it wrong
Y'all better go back, do your Google research and look some more
Watch them YouTube vids 'bout the man with them bullet scars
West' and Butch' would tell you, it was the crooked jaw that took us off
Verses was eye-poppin', we sky rocketed ('Kay)
My mind shine like diamonds in one of Westside watches (Hahaha)
Went from buyin' sixty-two grams to goin' pie shoppin'
My shooter on tour with me, he just was on Crime Stoppers (Facts, nigga)
Shit, they still lookin' for him
Nigga had a brick, gave me two thousand to cook it for him (Okay)
'Chine give the go, niggas hit your top with a bullet for him (Ha)
I get big money at will when I'm puttin' letters together, I Wheel of Fortune
I show niggas love, somehow, I'm still the villain for it
She tryna fuck a rapper so she can feel important
That's why she tryna be all in my section with liquor pourin'


[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
It's six in the mornin', police at my door
Guns by the bed, money in the floor
Neighbors lookin' at me like, ""He sell that raw""
Fiends know it's pure, so they keep comin' for more
And the blood keep callin', time to up that score
One hand scratch the other one, that's just law
Your bitch lookin' at me like, ""He got that raw""
Fiends know it's pure, so they keep comin' for more

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
My style is minimalistic, plain Jane simplistic
I'm like Ace and Money Mitch, but really on some pimp shit
Fallin' off ain't too realistic, niggas tellin' tales
Could sell you news stories, but this crack still sells
Rule number one, never ghost the clientele (Never)
Fiends linin' at my door, they need that shit now
Ten Crack Commandments, yo, I knows it too well
This the same dope I'm dishin' out, just on a different scale
Let me break it down if you don't see the vicious steel
You see, I got them hooked on the real
I bossed up and went to Colombia for the deal
Like, fuck the pop a pill shit, this that pure raw they wanna feel
Scarcity in the market, I'm expandin' the margin
And it's only a problem if the product ain't what it's promised
'Cause any competition get demolished
These niggas know my shit hit the hardest, to be honest
Graduated from the school of hard rock with my honors
Started on the block and made it to the top from the bottom
Used to cook it at my grandmama spot, we was starvin'
Right on Vernon, truth be timeless
Block away from Marcy Projects, we was prospects
Gainin' knowledge on the different ways to fill our pockets
Tryna make a profit in order to afford every object we desired
Like, one day I'll retire
But for now, I'll be the main supplier of that fuckin' fire


[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
It's six in the mornin', police at my door
Guns by the bed, money in the floor
Neighbors lookin' at me like, ""He sell that raw""
Fiends know it's pure, so they keep comin' for more
And the blood keep callin', time to up that score
One hand scratch the other one, that's just law
Your bitch lookin' at me like, ""He got that raw""
Fiends know it's pure, so they keep comin' for more"

Call me Mr. Put-That-Shit-On
Even since pockets was light as a feather
Uh, they think this lifestyle easy Even though they could never just achieve it, uh
Start to wonder why they hating
All I had to do was give 'em a reason
Nowadays, everyone changing Everyone changing on me like the

If I hit this ho she gon' tell
I guess that's life when you at the Four Seasons

The lil' body Bentley just isn't enough
When I get up l'ma need me that truck
When I get up, man, I promise it's stuck
And I'll do it again just to show it ain't luck
Swerving the coupe with the trunk in the front

[Verse 1]
I just went, bought a watch with a whole lot of diamonds to show all these niggas it's my time
Took a trip out to Cali to hang with the Crips, make a play, and get high off that zaza
I say RIP Kobe, a nigga so fly, when I ball, I'll fuck around, skydive
So much chicken on me, could've went bought a Williams, a Rudy's, a big-ass Popeye's
In a whole different bracket, this life is immaculate
If you hit me for 'bows, then you know that I'm taxin'
Keep buying clothes, that shit still in the packages
If he say that he robbed me, he cappin' then
Really know niggas throw sevens like Kaepernick
You not blind, thеn you see that we havin' it
Known in my city, so no, I'm not average
Camе a long way from dope in the cabinet

[Chorus]
Niggas know that I step (Uh-huh)
And the gang that I rep (Uh-huh)
Went to Solomon, iced out the ten, put six hundred on all of our neck (Uh-huh)
Paid in full like Mitch (Mhm)
Really havin' this shit (Mhm)
Got off of that step, started rapping and six months later, I'm rich (Mhm)


[Verse 2]
Nigga know I'm a stepper, I step with some elegance
All these niggas I'm with is some felons
And strapped with a post, so I hope that you Heaven-sent
If they spin, make 'em wish that they never spinned
Most of these niggas is hoes, they be telling it
Man, I'm finna take over, I'm stampin' it
How you bang this? Hit that cell and ain't reppin' shit
Left your dog in that rain and ain't help with it
How is you solid? You ain't never dealt with it
You see, me, I come different, I'm blessed with it
Went got the Rollie, it go with my necklace
Thirty for both, you could die if you mess with it
Can't do the show if it don't got a check with it
These niggas po-po, I swear they irrelevant
Hatin' like I don't know that's really jealously
Knowing they mad that they no longer next to me

[Chorus]
Niggas know that I step (Uh-huh)
And the gang that I rep (Uh-huh)
Went to Solomon, iced out the ten, put six hundred on all of our neck (Uh-huh)

I'd never met you, but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're

So slow it down

Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down

Ain't it funny how it changes?
How the future rearranges
I get nervous, oh, I'm anxious
Maybe loving you is dangerous
I could lose you like the others
Only girl that's never left me is my mother
Oh, I love her
And I know you'll probably hate it, but I'm

[Verse 1: Money Man]
I put her diamonds because she the finest
I put her in Ricky, she holdin' my blicky
AMG Wagon, it sit like a Tonka
Hang out the window, I'm holdin' the chopper
My jeans Dior, but got Burberry boxers
Manicure Russian, her face was Korean
Money increasin', it never depletin'
She was a hood bitch, I showed her the ropes
Put her  in Prada, she used to be broke
Trappin' or robbin', which one you gon' pick?
When you from where I from, nigga, good don't exist
Townhouse, two levels, it got luxury amenities
I buy that bitch with a made-up identity
Shoppin' boutiques on the daily, splurgin'
I fuck her good, now her toes curlin'
Japanese bitch finna walk on my back
Did a show in the hood, I was clutchin' my strap
She not my type, she not turnt up enough
Expensive bitch, pay some hundred for lunch
Stack up them bricks and she rockin' like six
She 'bout her business, she stay on her shit
Walk in Chanel, cop her two or three purses
Fuck it, right now, it's a hundred for verses
Bottega trainers, she run to that mun-yun
On an opp day, ride around with a hundun
Racks in the pillow case, I do not need a safe
When you go strike, make sure they do not see your face
I up that whistle if I feel offended
He not really like that, he just be pretendin'
She not my type, she not turnt up enough
She not my type, she not turnt up enough
She 'bout her business, so I had to cuff
She from the hood, but I put her in Prada
She was a seven, but now she a model
Bottega trainers, I got her in trainin'
Run up that pape', got accounts in the Caymans
Runnin' my hood, they be worship and praisin'


[Chorus: Money Man & Moneybagg Yo]
She not my type, she ain't turnt up enough
She not my type, she ain't turnt up enough
Yeah, we fucked, but I ain't like her that much
That nigga trash, they just hypin' him up
Maybach truck outside, I'm scoopin' her up
Muscle car, foreign car, which should I whip? (Go)
Get shot in your face, you lil' niggas ain't slick (Baow)
I raised this bank account, bitch, I'm the shit (Speak)

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
I'm way too big for a skeleton Carti'
I talk too much shit, man, I had to go 'Rari
Loaf boy, SG, nigga can't guard me
New strand ready and another finna harvest
Just takin' off, but the show been started (Yeah)
Late, that's the Wock', got me pullin' up tardy
I shitted on purpose, better not say sorry
The brand new foreign
Loyalty, I'm stayin' down with my niggas (Loaf)
""Spoil me,"" that's what I hear from my bitches (Both)
The chop that I got, it can't fit in my britches
AR black and brown, this the Virgil edition
This year, almost spend 'bout a ticket on opps (Woah)
I'm tired of sparin' these ho-ass niggas
The back of the Glock got a lil' bitty box
You tap on the trigger, it let off a fifty
Hit it (Grrt), hit it (Grrt), hit it (Grrt), hit it (Grrt)
Who want the smoke? I don't hear nothin', crickets
Why niggas hate? I don't know and don't get it
I know what it is, they see competition
They know I'm a threat
Extra, doin' too much
These niggas actors, but not like a movie 'cause they don't get paid (Broke)
Not like a trick (No)
I'm an investor
Lift up your titties, move you out of state


[Chorus: Money Man]
She not my type, she ain't turnt up enough
She not my type, she ain't turnt up enough
Yeah, we fucked, but I ain't like her that much
That nigga trash, they just hypin' him up

I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Uh, day-to-day same thoughts
This is all the devil's fault
I ain't mean to name drop
Off three, I pop, all three, I'm off, all three
Should make it four like the rings on my Audi
Xans with the Everclear got me seein' foggy
Ironic how somethin' clear got me seein' foggy
Something ain't right 'bout the pills but I bought them
Something ain't right with my mind so I lost it
Drugs turn my knob, then I run, that's a faucet
But it ain't water, it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high, it's exhausting
I was told it gets better with time


[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong

[Verse 2: Clever]
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Unless a Postmates' comin' on the way
But my cellphone isn't well-known
Go the hell on
""Pretty please, get me these
Buy me this, buy me that,"" bitch, hit your knees
I wasn't prepared for a guest
I'm aware of the stress, I don't care to impress
Can't you see that I am high on drugs?
And low on the sleep
I just wanna go somewhere and count my sheep
I'm tired, I'm tired
Gettin' high is exhausting
But I was told it gets better with time


[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own

Aching all through the night
Chasing shadows in the moonlight
Stuck in the streets with no name
Looking for your footprints in rain

[Pre-Chorus]
We're lost, lost in this dream
Waiting on you, summer and spring

[Chorus]
Sorry for our loss
And all the empty space
Sorry for the cost
It took on us that day
It shouldn't feel this way

[Verse 2]
Feels like an empty hotel
Wiping away all the dust on the shelf
Moving away from the coast
Where I'd walk the beaches talking to a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm caught, caught out at sea
No way you're floating back to me


[Chorus]
Sorry for our loss
And all the empty space
Sorry for the cost
It took on us that day
It shouldn't feel this way
(It shouldn't feel this way)

Take my hand
Try if you can
Silence is

(Welcome to Get A Bag Records)
I'm the guy who fly them in, bump it to me, tie you in
It's all right, we already had the shake back, nigga, try again
Made some paper, it's a perfect day to play, I ride the Benz
Niggas play, I ride with FN, once you pay, I'm 'bout to send

[Verse]
I be leavin' bricks around, I be leavin' pistols out (Oh)
I be counting bands with these hoes 'fore I dick them down (They liek that)
Oh, I used to hitch the home, you do under fifty-five (Drive)
I can take you right past Cеdar Point and get us fifty thou'
If I get indicted, ain't no bond, I'm a flight risk
Gеt a rise out of buyin' bad bitches nice shit. (That's my life)
Keep it on me and you check the stash, it's a pipe there
Down the way, if they don't got no snow, I'm sellin' ice here (That pure what?)
Used to double, now I know the song so I can triple with it
He ain't die, we cripple niggas, spinnin' at the 'spittle with him
Straight for a hustle, I ain't dealin' in no tricky business
You ain't spend enough of me to move, boy, come and get them bitches
He ain't throw a rock, nigga, quit sayin' you don't rock with us
Threw his hands up, lookin' dumb as hell, popped him up (Baow)
French fry combination meal, chicken box him up (He go)
Niggas set a play on Argo, have to call an audible (Switch it up)
Hit a bitch on camera just to listen to the audio
Get out on the mission 'cause I miss hearin' that carbon blow
Niggas get on Instagram and get to writin' articles (Like hoes)
Beefin' like the baddies, all I see is bitches arguin'
Attachments, we got gadgets, we can see a nigga poppin' up
Blow my mind how these niggas broke as hell and popular (It fuck me up)
Some nights it be crazy, I throw singles in my tub
All these singles from my fans, I got more singles than the club (Nigga)
Call Maxine, livin' single in your hood (I'm posted)
I'll up some shit right now that not a single nigga could (Dog shit)
It's so slimy where I'm from, ain't no friends through that bitch
I ain't trippin', fuck some niggas, I made bands over here
Niggas life ain't even worth twenty grams off the brick
I ain't ashy, bitch, I'm really havin' hands in this shit
First time in the McLaren, had to learn to grip the wheel
Super freak, she like to eat me up, be firm and grip her head (Grip her head)
Platinum wrist, I'm stackin' chips, putting chips on niggas plan
You can't fuck with me for real, that shit be all in niggas heads (That's all in your imagination)
It cost a quarter ticket just for me to turn the album in
Smellin' like Staheli, feelin' crazy at a rap event (Damn)
I don't give a fuck if Stevie Wonder here, it's strap in here
Nigga lame, I'll probably leave the states before I rap with him
He ain't even sellin' dope for real, he so inaccurate
Look, my kid immaculate, I got a sale right after this (Bag life)


[Chorus]
I'm the guy who fly them in, bump it to me, tie you in
It's all right, we already had the shake back, nigga, try again
Make some paper, it's a perfect day to play, I ride the Benz
Niggas play, I ride with FN, once you pay, I'm 'bout to send (They on the way)
I'm the guy who fly them in, bump it to me, tie you in (On God)
It's all right, we already had the shake back, nigga, try again
Make some paper, it's a perfect day to play, I ride the Benz (Ride the Benz)
Niggas play, I ride with FN (Ride with FN), once you pay, I'm 'bout to send (I'm 'bout to send)

Oh brother, this guy stinks

Yeah, uh, check

[Verse 1: IDK]
I'm in the lead, top priority (Yeah)
Fuck with a G, now you finna see (Yeah)
Flip over the bed, all you really sleep (Yeah)
You made a year what I made a week (Yeah)
Yes, I got motion, run out of motion, I go get more then
She like the way I smell 'cause the YSL potent
She got a little jealous when she heard who I was strokin'
My last girlfriend ain't got nothin' on your throat, friend
Go off, the way she fuck, she such a show-off
And I don't ever ask when it's time to take her clothes off
She like to let it breathe, she don't like to wear no drawls
And when she get depressed, treat my dick like Zoloft
You fuck with the fuckin' best, you fuckin' the fuckin' best
I shoot with protection on, but for you, I don't need no vest
I aim for the fuckin' face, I aim for the fuckin' chest
She said she make swimwear, that pussy make me invest

[Chorus: IDK]
Prayin' for a genie rub, prayin' to the stars above
I just wanna fall in love, I just wanna fall in love
Wishin' for a four-leaf clove, prayin' you’re the pot of gold

Gotta keep it goin', gotta get ahead

One for me and one for my bread
This the new bap that take you way back (Yeah)
Givin' no slack, my bed is on stacks (Yeah)
Don't sleep, I got to get my bag on
Oops, forgot to turn my swag on

[Verse 3: Brae]
Venue house, slaughter, killer
Flow so cold it's icey, shiver
Punch your jaw, body shot liver
Baddies weak for Brae, huh, quiver
Let me get down to the brass tax
I'm final boss, no printer, all fax
You stepped into a disaster
You doomed, better pray to the pastor

[Chorus: IDK]
Prayin' for a genie rub, prayin' to the stars above
I just wanna fall in love, I just wanna fall in love
Wishin' for a four-leaf clove, prayin' you’re the pot of gold

[Verse 4: IDK]
Hahaha, I step in like a X-Man
Make her come back like I'm her ex man
If she don't make me feel good, well, here's the exit
If she make me feel good, we can co-exist
Fuck her, make her go home, no co-ed shit
Niggas be comin' with all bull, I'm a matador
Say they want my soul, I swing the cape, dodgin' devil horns
Used to never want to press play, here's a metaphor
Now your boy clicks on my dick like he watchin' porn
I fucked up after bein' fucked up
Four-leaf clover got stepped on, tough luck
'Nough said, I'm a diamond in the rough, nuck buck
But am I good franchise ad-lib? Yeah, yeah
In my white tee, she claimin' that she wifey (Yeah)
I'm sayin' ""What's your sign""? 'Cause your pussy smell like Pisces (Yeah, yeah)
Or like a pescatarian, I'm killin' and I'm buryin' (Yeah)

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh, yeah

Shit, you mothafuckin' right!
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, west side! What?! Bring it on!

[Refrain: 2Pac]
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Our childhood years recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor — father, forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, Ready to Die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop


[Interlude: Virginya Slim]
What?! I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas
Run, nigga, run! I'm on yo' ass, nigga
Run, nigga! Duck and hide
When I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga! Yeah, Westside!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend

[Chorus: 2Pac]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend


[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‘cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war, never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall: me and my girlfriend

[Chorus: 2Pac]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend


[Verse 4: 2Pac]
I love finger-fuckin' you, all of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit, you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend

[Chorus: 2Pac]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (Yeah, that's right, uh)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down; give me love!

[Verso 1: Beyoncé]
Eu olho profundamente nos seus olhos (Eu...)
Eu toco em você mais e mais toda vez
Quando você sai, eu fico implorando pra você não ir
Chamo seu nome, duas, três vezes seguidas
É uma coisa tão engraçada pra eu tentar explicar
Como estou me sentindo, e o meu orgulho é o culpado (Yeah)
Porque eu sei que não entendo
Como o seu amor pode fazer o que ninguém mais pode

Quando eu falo com as minhas amigas no quieto
(""Quem ele pensa que é?"") Olha o que você fez comigo
De tênis, nem preciso comprar um vestido novo
Se você não estiver aí, não tenho mais ninguém pra impressionar
É o jeito que você sabe o que eu pensei que sabia
É a batida que meu coração faz quando estou com você
Mas eu ainda não entendo
Como o seu amor pode fazer o que ninguém mais pode

Tô em forma, mas os bolsos são gordos igual o Tony (Oh, não)

Eu balaço esses falsos, cara, você não pode chegar perto
O artigo genuíno, eu não canto
Eu atiro, se acontecer algo, eu te mato
Uma estrela igual o Ringo, guerra igual uma Boina Verde
Você é louco? Traga a sua tropa toda
O JAY-Z tá na Range, louco e perturbado
Eles não conseguem entendê-lo, eles estão tipo, ""Hey, ele é louco?"" (Oh, não)
Sim senhor, eu fui feito de um tecido diferente
Minha textura é o melhor casaco de pele: chinchila
Tenho estado mais foda do que os fumantes compulsivos
Como você acha que ganhei o nome Hova?
Tenho sido o mais real, o jogo acabou
Volte isso, Young
Desde que eu fiz a mudança pra platina
O jogo já tem um dono, faloupç


[Ponte: Beyoncé]
Me deixou, tão louca, meu amor
Eu não sou eu mesma ultimamente, sou tola, eu não faço isso
Eu estive brincando comigo mesma, baby, eu não me importo
Porque o seu amor tira o melhor de mim
E baby, você está me deixando boba
Você me pegou de jeito e eu não me importo com quem vê
Porque baby, você me pegou, você me deixou
Você me deixou, me deixou tão louca, baby
Hey!

Me deixou tão louca agora

Oh-oh

[Verse 1: Chilli & Left Eye]
A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a busta (Busta)
Always talkin' 'bout what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli & Left Eye]
No, I don't want your number (Uh, uh-uh)
No, I don't wanna give you mine and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere (No)
No, don't want none of your time and (Uh)

[Chorus: Chilli & T-Boz, Left Eye]
No, I don't want no scrub (Uh)
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me (Woo)
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh-uh, no love)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Trying to holla at me

[Verse 2: Chilli & Left Eye]
Well, a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get with a deadbeat ass, so (Yeah)


[Pre-Chorus: Chilli & Left Eye]
No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine and (Said no)
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, don't want none of your time (Check it)

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh-huh, come on)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me (Hah)
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh-uh, no love)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

If you don't have a car and you're walkin'
Oh, yes, son, I'm talkin' to you
If you live at home with your mama
Oh, yes, son, I'm talkin' to you (Baby)
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh, yes, son (Yeah), I'm talkin' to you (Yeah)
Wanna get with me with no money, oh no
I don't want no

A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride (Yeah)
Trying to holla at me
[Verse 3: Left Eye]
See, if you can't spatially expand my horizons (Horizons)
Then that leaves you in a class with scrubs, never risin' (Risin')
I don't find it surprisin' if you don't have the G's
To please me and bounce from here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you somethin' to think about (Think about)
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out (Turn you out)
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me (In front of me)
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens (Digital TV screens)
Satisfy my appetite with somethin' spectacular (Spectacular)
Check your vernacular, and then I'll get back to ya (Then I'll get back to ya)
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition
Mister Big Willy
If you really wanna know, ask Chilli
Could I be a silly ho? Not really
T-Boz and all my señoritas are steppin' on your FILAs
But you don't hear me, though


[Chorus: Chilli & T-Boz, Left Eye]
No, I don't want no scrub (No)
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride (Uh, yeah)
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub (No scrub)
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (No love)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me"

Bin im Club mit meinen Homies
Auf der Suche nach Sex, ohne Aufsehen zu erregen (Erregen)
Denn du weißt, wie es ist (Hey, hey)
Ich hab' diе Süße gesehеn, sie hat mich abgecheckt
Bei der Art, wie sie mir ins Ohr geflüstert hat, könnte man meinen, dass sie mich kennt (Kennt)
Ich hab' beschlossen, ruhig zu bleiben (Okay)
Die Unterhaltung wurde lauter (Hey)
Und ich hatte das Gefühl, sie ist bereit mir einen zu blasen
Pass auf! (Oh)
Pass auf!
Sie hat gesagt: „Komm, fang mich“ (Komm, fang mich)
Also bin ich aufgestanden und ihr auf die Tanzfläche gefolgt
Sie meinte: „Baby, los geht's“ (Los geht's)

Sodass ich denke, es wär 'ne gute Idee, sie mit zu mir zu nehmen (Zu nehmen)
Denn sie ist bereit zu gehen (Bereit zu gehen; oh, los geht's)
Und jetzt muss ich ganz ehrlich sein (Ja)
Auf einer Skala von 1 bis 10 ist sie locker 'ne 20
Aber das bin ich einfach nicht (Hey)
Denn ich weiß nicht, wenn ich mein Glück versuche
Wohin das am Ende führt
Aber was ich weiß: Die Art, wie die sie tanzt
Macht die Süße in meinen Augen perfekt (Hey, hey, hey)
Wie sie runtergeht
Ich denk' mir so: „Ja, genauso kannst du das für mich auch machen“
Sie wollte noch eine Runde tanzen
Und ich so: „Ja, wie zur Hölle könnte ich jetzt gehen?“ Und ich meinte (Los geht's, bring den Beat zurück)

Im Club bin ich nicht zu übersehen
Und roar, diese Frauen sind alle auf Beutezug
Wenn du den Kopf still hältst, werd' ich die Kuh melken (Yeah)
Und vergiss das ganze Gelaber, jetzt mein' ich's ernst (Was?)
Ich werd' nicht aufhören, bis sie vor mir ist, wie Gott sie schuf (Yeah)
Also gib mir den Rhythmus und die Klamotten werden fliegen
Dann beug' ich dich nach vorne über und berühr' deine Zehen
Ich hab' den Jaguar stehen lassen und den Rolls-Royce genommen
Wenn sie nicht mit zu mir kommen, sollen sie eben zu Fuß gehen (Los geht's, oh!)
Was hältst du jetzt von mir
Wenn allein mein Ringfinger über 300.000 wert ist?
Lass uns trinken, ich versuch' es dir recht zu machen (Yeah)
Ludacris füllt Gläser/Körbe wie Doppel-D (Yeah)
Ich und Usher sind zurück und hinterlassen nichts als Asche
Wir wollen eine, die draußen elegant ist, aber ein Freak im Bett und schreit

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

[Verse 1]
And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

[String Solo]


[Verse 2]
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 2]
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd break down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive


[Outro]
I've got all my life to live, and I've got so much love to give
And I'll survive, yes, I'll survive, yeah, I'll survive"

I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV (rock and roll TV)
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man


[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom!
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
I will not give you up (Freedom!)
Gotta have some faith in the sound
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got, (Freedom!)
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
So please don't give me up (Freedom!)
Cause I would really, really love to stick around (You got to give what you take)

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick, just a buddy and me
(What a kick, just a buddy and me)
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change oh yeah (Oh, yeah)
Now I'm gonna get myself happy


[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don’t think that I’ll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
I will not give you up, (Freedom!)
Gotta have some faith in the sound
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got (Freedom!)
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
So please don't give me up (Freedom!)
Cause I would really, really love to stick around (You got to give what you take)


[Bridge]
Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get, that's what you get, that's what you get
I say that's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind
And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now (Oh, yeah)
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom! (Oh!)
Freedom!
(My) Freedom!
You got to give what you take!
Freedom!
I'll hold on to my (Freedom!)
My (Freedom!)
You got to give what you take! (You got to give what, to give what, to give what you take!)

[Outro]
Yeah!
You got to give what, to give what, to give
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live"

There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, ""Brandy, fetch another round""
She serves them whiskey and wine

[Chorus]
The sailors say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

[Verse 2]
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

[Chorus]
The sailor said, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea


[Bridge]
Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes when he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise, she saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

[Verse 3]
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

[Chours]
She hears him say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is, it is
""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is, it is"

Looking for the love getaway
Headed for the love getaway
I got me a car that's as big as a whale
And we're heading on down to the Love Shack
I got me a Chrysler that seats about 20
So hurry up and bring your jukebox money

Dancing and a-loving
Wearing next to nothing

And around and around and around
Everybody's moving, everybody's grooving, baby
Folks lining up outside just to get down
Everybody's moving, everybody's grooving, baby
Funky little shack

I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

But they'll never throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow
Realised what you're not to do

Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all

Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)

[Verso 1: JAY-Z & Rihanna]
No hay nubes en mis piedras
Que llueva, planeo sobre la cuenta bancaria
Descendiendo con el Dow Jones (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Cuando lleguen las nubes, nos vamos, somos Roc-A-Fella (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
Volamos más alto que el clima, en un G5 o mejor
Me conoces (Me conoces)
Preparándome para la tormenta, acumulando dinero para el día de lluvia
Jay, el hombre de la tormenta ha vuelto (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
Con la pequeña señorita rayo de sol, Rihanna, ¿dónde estás? (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)

[Verso 2: Rihanna]
Tienes mi corazón, y nunca estaremos separados
Tal vez en revistas, pero seguirás siendo mi estrella
Cariño, porque en la oscuridad, no puedes ver coches brillantes
Y es cuando me necesites aquí
Contigo, siempre compartiré porque

[Coro: Rihanna]
Cuando el sol brille, brillamos juntos
Te dije que estaré aquí para siempre
Dije, ""siempre seré tu amiga""
Hice un juramento, lo cumpliré hasta el final

Nunca intervendrán entre nosotros
Eres parte de mi ser
Aquí para siempre
Cuando la guerra haya tomado su parte
Cuando el mundo haya repartido sus cartas
Si la mano es dura
Juntos, repararemos tu corazón porque

The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends

It was sung by Micky Dolenz and written by Neil Diamond.
It appeared on the second Monkees album, More of the Monkees.[Verse 1]
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else, but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

[Chorus]
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

[Verse 2]
I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave, the less I got
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine, I got rain

[Chorus]
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey

Our, our hearts a thumpin'

To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

'Cause all I see are stilettos

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Intro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Ey
Fonsi, DY
Oh, oh nein, oh nein (ey)
Hey, ja!
Dididiri Daddy, los!
Ja, du weißt, ich verbringe schon eine Weile dich anzusehen
Ich muss mit dir heute tanzen (DY!)
Ich sah, dass dein Blick schon nach mir rief
Zeig' mir den Weg, den ich gehe

[Strophe 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Oh, du, du bist der Magnet und ich bin das Stück Metall
Ich komme gerade näher und ich schmiede einen Plan
Nur daran zu denken lässt meinen Puls ansteigen (Oh ja)
Schon, schon gefällt es mir besser als das Normale
Alle meine Sinne verlangen nach mehr
Das muss man mit keiner Bedrängnis angehen

[Refrain: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Langsam
Ich möchte langsam in deinen Rachen einatmen
Lass mich dir Sachen in dein Ohr sagen
Damit du dich erinnerst, falls du nicht bei mir bist
Langsam
Ich möchte dich zu langsamen Küssen ausziehen
An den Wänden deines Labyrinths unterschreiben
Und aus deinem ganzen Körper ein Manuskript machen
(Hoch, hoch, hoch
Geh hoch hoch)


[Post-Refrain: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Ich möchte dein Haar tanzen sehen
Ich möchte dein Rhythmus sein
Zeig meinem Mund
Deine liebsten Stellen (Liebsten, liebsten, Baby)
Lass mich deine gefährlichen Zonen übersteigen
Bis ich deinen Schrei provoziere
Und du deinen Nachnamen vergisst

[Strophe 2: Daddy Yankee]
Wenn ich dich um einen Kuss bitte, komm, gib ihn mir!
Ich weiß, dass du es gerade denkst
Ich stecke da schon einige Zeit rein
Mami, das ist ein Geben und ein Nehmen
Du weißt, dass dein Herz mit mir Bumm-Bumm macht
Du weißt, dieses Baby nach meinem Bang-Bang
Komm, probiere von meinem Mund um zu sehen wie es schmeckt
Ich will, ich will, ich will sehen wie viel Liebe in dich passt
Ich habe keine Eile, ich möchte mir diese Reise gönnen
Wir fangen langsam an, danach wild

[Pre-Refrain: Daddy Yankee]
Schritt für Schritt, sanft, ganz sanft
Wir kommen uns nah, ganz allmählich
Wenn du mich so gekonnt küsst
Sehe ich, dass du die Böswilligkeit mit Zartheit bist
Schritt für Schritt, sanft, ganz sanft
Wir kommen uns nah, ganz allmählich
Denn diese Schönheit ist ein Puzzle
Aber um sie zusammenzusetzen, habe ich das Puzzlestück
Hey!


[Refrain: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Langsam
Ich möchte langsam in deinen Rachen einatmen
Lass mich dir Sachen in dein Ohr sagen
Damit du dich erinnerst, falls du nicht bei mir bist
Langsam
Ich möchte dich zu langsamen Küssen ausziehen
An den Wänden deines Labyrinths unterschreiben
Und aus deinem ganzen Körper ein Manuskript machen

Lass mich deine gefährlichen Zonen übersteigen
Bis ich deinen Schrei provoziere
Und du deinen Nachnamen vergisst

[Bridge: Luis Fonsi]
Langsam
Lass es uns an einem Strand in Puerto Rico machen
Bis die Wellen schreien: „Hey, Schönheit!“
Bleiben Sie mit meiner Dichtung
Tanz!


[Outro: Daddy Yankee & Luis Fonsi]
Langsam, langsam, sachte, sachte (Oh, ja-ja)
Wir werden langsam ganz langsam aufhören
Lehre meinem Mund
Deine liebsten Stellen
Liebsten, liebsten, Baby (Uh)
Langsam, langsam, sachte, sachte
Wir werden langsam ganz langsam aufhören
Bis ich deinen Schrei provoziere (Fonsi)

Dr. Dre & Queen Pen (Deutsche Übersetzung) Lyrics[Deutscher Songtext zu „No Diggity“]

[Intro]
Ja
Wisst ihr was?
Ich mag die Playettes
Ohne Zweifel, ohne Zweifel, ah
Mach weiter, Playette
Mach weiter, Playette
Yo, Dre, hau raus

[Strophe 1: Dr. Dre]
Es geht ab, blende zu Blackstreet
Die Homies haben es auf mich abgesehen, Kollaborationskreationen sind wie Akne
Kein Zweifel, ich hab's drauf, ich bin nie nachlässig
Solange mein Kredit bürgt, könnte mich kein Hund schnappen
Sag mir, wer aufhören kann, wenn Dre Moves macht
Die Mädels wie ein Magnet anzieht
Ihnen Ohrgasmen gebe mit meinem sanften Akzent
Ich bewege immer noch diesen Flair
Mit den Kumpels Blackstreet und Teddy
Die echten Rump Shaker

[Strophe 2: Teddy Riley]
Shawty, geht in die Knie, guter Gott
Baby hat die ganze Stadt für sich offen
Strikt im Geschäft, sie spielt nicht herum
Sie deckt viele Gebiete ab, Kundschaft in Massen
Bezahlt zu werden ist ihre Stärke
Jeden einzelnen Tag, wie ein echter Player
Ich kriege sie nicht aus dem Kopf (Wow)
Ich denke die ganze Zeit an das Mädchen (Wow-wow)
Von der Eastside zur Westside
Pusht fette Fahrten, es ist keine Überraschung
Sie hat Tricks im Versteck, stapelt das Geld
Schnell, wenn es um das Benzin geht
Auf keinen Fall durchschnittlich
Sie ist dabei, wenn sie es haben muss
Baby, du bist eine perfekte Zehn, ich will mitmachen
Kann ich einsteigen, damit ich gewinnen kann?


[Refrain: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Tüte es ein)
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Tüte es ein, Mädchen)
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Tüte es ein)
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Steh auf)

[Strophe 3: Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
Sie hat Klasse und Stil
Straßenkenntnise in Hülle und Fülle
Baby benimmt sich nie wild
Sehr dezent im Profil
Gefühle zu bekommen ist ein Tabu
Ich sage euch, wie's geht
Kraut ist das Wort, drehen ist das Verb
Liebende, es kurvt, also flippt aus, was ihr gehört habt
Rollt mit der Geilheit
Du hast überhaupt keine Ahnung
Ihr müsst fürs Spielen bezahlen
Nur damit Shawty Bang-Bang in deine Richtung schaut
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Den ganzen Tag lang stramm, jeden Tag
Du sprengst meinen Verstand, vielleicht mit der Zeit
Kann ich dich in meinem Wagen mitnehmen, Baby


[Refrain: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Tüte es ein)
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Oh, ja)
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Tüte es ein, Babe)
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Steh auf)

[Break: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, dieses Mädchen sieht gut aus)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Mach weiter, mach weiter, mach weiter)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Du bist ein Mädchen nach meinem Geschmack)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

[Strophe 4: Queen Pen]
Denn das sind meine Kumpels und wir rollen tief
Fliege in der ersten Klasse von New York City nach Blackstreet
Was weißt du über mich? Nicht ein Ding
Cartier-Holzrahmen, getragen von meiner Shawty
Was mich betrifft, eisig schimmernder Diamantring am kleinen Finger
Wir sind die übelste Clique in der Szene
Hast du keine Langeweile mit diesen falschen Bräuten?
Ich zeige und beweise, ohne Zweifel, dass ich dich mag
Also bitte entschuldigt, wenn ich unhöflich rüberkomme, das bin einfach ich
Und so muss eine Playette sein
Bleib am Ball mit einem großen B
Fragt die Leute in meinem Block, ich bin so echt wie es nur geht
Das Wort ist Programm, ich habe mich nie verstellt
Also, Teddy, gib die Nachricht an Chauncy weiter
Ich sende den Anruf, sagen wir, gegen 3:30
Queen Pen und Blackstreet, das ist kein Zuckerschlecken (Kein Zweifel, kein Zweifel, Baby)


[Refrain: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]

Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Girl, du hast es drauf)
Ich mag, wie du es machst
Kein Zweifel, ich tüte es ein (Mach weiter, mach weiter, mach weiter)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) Ich mag, wie du es machst

Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""people,"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple, huh
It's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?
You get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)
It's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it
There's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership


[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)

[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters the same, but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanest"" or ""meanest""
I won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away
He had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door
Now don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount


[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies)

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach,"" I said, ""Now, child, please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go""
I said, ""Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it


[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)

[Verse 1]
Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

[Chorus]
'Cause I gotta' have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say, ""Please, please, please don't go away""
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe (Huh) you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules


[Pre-Chorus]
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for somethin' more

Yes I gotta have faith
Ooh, I gotta have faith

The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling; that's the power of love

[Verse 2]
Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

[Chorus 1]
It don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

[Verse 3]
First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad, baby, when you've found
That's the power, makes the world go 'round


[Chorus 1]
And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

[Bridge]
They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmm-mm, hmm

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2]
It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' 'til you feel
You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love

You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love

Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

To believe they never would
But now I…

Look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you?

Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yeah

[Verso 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, eu saí do Brooklyn, agora moro em Tribeca
Bem ao lado do De Niro, mas eu vou ser da quebrada pra sempre
Eu sou o novo Sinatra, e uma vez que eu fiz isso aqui
Eu posso fazer isso em qualquer lugar, yeah, eles me amam em todos os lugares
Eu costumava comprar no Harlem – olá, meus Dominicanos (Dinheiro!)
Bem ali na Broadway, me trouxe de volta naquele McDonald's
Levei isso pro meu esconderijo, 560 State Street
Me encontrе na cozinha, tipo um Simmons fazendo pastel
Cruzando pela 8ª Rua, um Lеxus todo branco
Dirigindo tão devagar, mas a Beyocé é do Texas
Eu? Eu saí de Bed-Stuy, casa do garoto Biggie
Agora eu moro na Billboard e trouxe meus meninos comigo
Diga ""E aí"" pro Ty Ty, ainda bebendo Mai Tais
Sentado ao lado da quadra, os Knicks e os Nets me cumprimentam
Mano, eu tô fora de combate (Qual é), eu posso derrubar um árbitro (Qual é)
Digo pela minha atitude (Qual é) que eu definitivamente sou de

[Refrão: Alicia Keys e Jay-Z]
Em Nova York (Ayy, aha) (Uh, yeah)
Selva de concreto (Yeah) onde os sonhos são feitos
Não existe nada que você não possa fazer (Yeah) (Okay)
Agora você está em Nova York (Aha, aha, aha) (Uh, yeah)
Essas ruas vão te fazer se sentir novo (Novo)
As luzes grandes vão te inspirar (Vamo lá) (Okay)
Vamos ouvir isso por Nova York (De nada, OG) (Uh)
Nova York (Yeah), Nova York (Uh) (Eu te deixei quente, mano)


[Verso 2: Jay-Z]
Me encontre no X com o OG em um jogo dos Yankee
Merda, eu deixei o boné do Yankee mais famoso do que um Yankee pode fazer
Você deve saber que o meu sangue é azul, mas no entanto não sou um Crip
Mas eu tenho uma gangue de manos andando com a minha tropa
Bem vindo ao caldeirão, esquinas onde vendemos pedra
Música do Afrika Bambaataa, casa do hip-hop
Táxi amarelo, táxi cigano, táxi do dólar, chega disso
Para os estrangeiros, não é justo, agem como se tivessem esquecido como somar
Oito milhões de histórias lá fora nuas
Cidade, é uma pena que metade de vocês não vai conseguir
Eu? Eu preciso ligar pro Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
Se o Jeezy tá pagando pro LeBron, eu tô pagando pro Dwyane Wade
Três dados, três cartas Marley
Desfile do Dia do Trabalho—descanse em paz, Bob Marley
Estátua da Liberdade, vida longa ao World Trade (Vamos lá, vamos lá)
Vida longa ao rei, yo (Vamos lá)—eu sou do Empire State, que é

[Refrão: Alicia Keys e Jay-Z]
Em Nova York (Ayy) (Uh, yeah)

Não existe nada que você não possa fazer (Esse garoto é bom) (Okay)
Agora você está em Nova York (Bem-vindo às luzes brilhantes, baby) (Uh, yeah)
Essas ruas vão te fazer se sentir novo
As luzes grandes vão te inspirar (Okay)
Vamos ouvir isso por Nova York (Uh)
Nova York (Yeah), Nova York (Uh)


[Verso 3: Jay-Z]
As luzes cegam, as garotas precisam de antolhos
Pra que elas possam sair dos limites rapidamente, as linhas laterais estão
Alinhadas com as vítimas que bebem a vida casualmente
Depois, gradualmente, pioram — não morda a maçã, Eva!
Preso no meio da multidão, agora você tá na moda
No inverno fica frio, na Vogue com sua pele amostra
A cidade do pecado é uma pena por capricho
Boas garotas que deram errado, a cidade tá cheia delas
A garota fez uma viagem de ônibus, agora ela tira a blusa
Todo mundo anda nela, assim como uma rota de ônibus
""Ave Maria"" pra cidade, você é uma virgem
E Jesus não pode te salvar, a vida começa quando a igreja acaba
Cheguei aqui pela escola, graduado para a alta vida
Jogadores de basquete, estrelas do rap, viciados em holofotes
O MDM (Vamos lá) A te deixa se sentindo como um campeão (Vamos lá)
A cidade nunca dorme (Vamos lá), é melhor tomar um Ambien

[Refrão: Alicia Keys e Jay-Z]
Em Nova York (Ayy, ow) (Uh, yeah)

Não existe nada que você não possa fazer (Okay)
Agora você está em Nova York (Uh, yeah)
Essas ruas vão te fazer se sentir novo
As luzes grandes vão te inspirar (Okay)
Vamos ouvir isso por Nova York (Uh)
Nova York (Yeah), Nova York (Uh)


[Ponte: Alicia Keys]
Uma mão no ar pela cidade grande (Oh)
Luzes da rua, grandes sonhos, tudo parecendo bonito (Oh)
Nenhum lugar no mundo poderia se comparar (Nah)
Coloque seus isqueiros no ar, todo mundo diz
""Yeah, yeah"" (Vamos lá, vamos lá)
""Yeah, yeah"" (Vamos lá)

[Refrão: Alicia Keys]
Em Nova York (Uh, yeah)
Selva de concreto onde os sonhos são feitos
Não existe nada que você não possa fazer (Okay)
Agora você está em Nova York (Uh, yeah)
Essas ruas vão te fazer se sentir novo

Every now and then, I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming 'round
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by

Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified

And I dream of something wild

And I'm lying like a child in your arms

'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together, we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (All of the time)

We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time, I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do

Nothing I can say

There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

Is it still, is it going? (Yeah yeah)
(Alright) So we gon’ do this one like for the RattPack and shit, is it recording?
Alright for the real hip-hop mothafuckas, you know what I’m sayin'?
(Yeah yeah) Shout out to Bobby, my engineer
It’s a nice night in L.A
We're recordin' this mixtape and shit, workin' on the album at the same time, you know what I’m sayin'?
Visionary boy
Yeah yeah, uh, yeah, we gon’ do it for 96’ (yeah)
We gon’ do it for hip-hop (yeah second renaissance type shit check it)

[Verse 1]
Who would have thought that painting pictures ’bout being broke
Would get me riches like dealing coke?
Like big brother used to do so we could stay afloat
I heard them guns outside my window, them gangsters would tote
Thought about the life I wanted, picked up the pen and then wrote
While they was firing, you could hear sirens
From people dialing 911 crying in the phone
I was in the zone, trying to make a living
Heading to work in the morning
Every day felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased
Until I quit my job, then my work ethic increased
Elevated to levels I ain’t ever seen
Stacking this cream, living the American dream now
I’m going crazy, I ain’t slept in days
Dreaming of Michael Jordan money like I slept in J’s
Always shouting out my team ’cause I get all the praise
But they the ones that motivate me on depressing days
See I’m from Maryland where cats draw gats like animation
From the smallest altercation, that can lead to termination
With a rapper on every corner, like the rest of the nation
Passing bars back and forth like legal examinations
As a youngin' I was running wild
Me and my homies skipping school, puffing on that loud
Doing shit just to do it, ’cause we wasn’t allowed
I thought I understood the world, but I was still a child, yeah
Now when my mama was at home drinking, thinking ’bout the bills
I was dreaming ’bout the mills, running round looking for thrills
I guess this is how it feels when your memory spills onto the page
And paints a picture of another age
Back in West Deer Park, chilling with shorties after dark
‘Cause when the sun is down, the police always want us down
‘Til we get older and hustle, now they try’na gun us down
We just trying to make a livin' off of what we’ve been given
Wassup


[Hook]
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on

[Verse 2]
They call me Logic, yeah that’s L-O-G-I-C
I ain’t wrapped up in them bitches, I just write ’bout shit I see
‘Cause these lyrics set me free, fuck the world, let me be
And when I feel like I can’t write, that’s when I hit the MPC
My talent limitless, but time is limited so listen up
If you can’t see the shit I see, you better get your vision up
I’m the king, watch me reign, born to rule my domain
Album ain’t even in stores, they tryna sue me for my name
Shit insane, so berserk, never complained, I just work
Chasing after my dreams like them high school skirts
Back as a youngin, spitting game, tryna get the nut in
Living life to the fullest ’cause them little things ain’t nothing
My flow unkillable when I be murdering syllables
But I take my time, slow it down, check the rhyme
Perfectionist to the dime, from the womb to the tomb
I be rapping ’til I’m dying, doing everything I love
That’s the life of a don, skipping school, sipping liquor
Tryna get this money quicker, bad bitches, good weed
That’s the type of shit I need
Lyrics bleed from my mind state
Elevate my mind and watch it rise like the crime rate
‘Cause sometimes I be high, and sometimes I be low
And sometimes I do shit I thought I'd never do before
My life is like a movie role that’s starring me, got these women on me
I hit the club with all my homies, and the drinks is on me
At the crib with the shorty that I met at the spot
Pretty eyes, nice lips, Grey Goose what she sips
Both my hands on her hips, ’til she put 'em on her tits
Freak bitch want the dick, biting on her finger tip
I only fuck with nice girls, I never do this type of shit
I’m thinking ’bout hitting it raw, shit I must be wildin' out
But that pussy wet as hell, I think it’s time to end the drought
Then again she could be burning, and that’s not what I’m about
So I dipped out, to live another day and die another night
‘Cause when I’m gone that ain’t gon' be the song that they recite
What up?

A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus]
So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died


[Chorus]
I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 3]
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""


[Verse 4]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

[Chorus]
We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 5]
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died


[Chorus]
He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

[Bridge]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

[Chorus]
And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

[Outro]
They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die"""

'Cause I tell a joke or two

Deep inside I'm blue

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Pre-Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal

But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

Son of a gun

[Verse 1]
You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror, as you watched yourself gavotte

And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner and

You're so vain

You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me

Clouds in my coffee and

Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not


[Pre-Chorus]
You're with some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend and

I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both

Would she go down on you in a theatre?
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no

But you're still alive

And are you thinkin' of me when you fuck her?

Well, can you feel it?

Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away

Tommy used to work on the docks

Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay

Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk

When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
""Baby, it's okay
Someday""

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better


[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better


[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

Out on the road today, I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, “Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go but

[Chorus]
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong

This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock a rhyme that's right on time, ""It's Tricky"" is the title (Here we go)

[Chorus: Rev Run, DMC, & Both]
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tr-tr-tr-tricky, tricky, tricky

[Verse 1: DMC & Rev Run]
I met this little girlie, her hair was kind of curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is, ""Please me""
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said, ""It's not that easy""

[Chorus: DMC, Rev Run, & Both]
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it D?)
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tricky, tricky, tricky

[Verse 2: DMC, Rev Run, & Both]
In New York, the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really hawk, but we just walk because we have no time
And in the city, it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside


[Chorus: DMC, Rev Run, & Both]
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it D?)
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky, huh

[Verse 3: DMC & Rev Run]
When I wake up, people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' 'cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' 'cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' 'cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father 'cause he's down with me

[Chorus: DMC, Rev Run, & Both]
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it?)
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky, tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tr

[Outro: DMC, Rev Run, & Both]
We are not thugs, we don't use drugs, but you assume on your own
They offer coke and lots of dope, but we just leave it alone
It's like that, y'all, y'all, but we don't quit
You keep on rock shock 'cause this is it"

[Verse 1]
Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there tryin' to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin' you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression

[Pre-Chorus]
Really I'm sad

Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Mmm-hmm, oh yeah, baby


[Verse 2]
Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

[Pre-Chorus]
Decided to go
(Why did you go?)
Oh, I need you so
(I need you so)
I'm hurt and I want you to know

But for others I put on a show

There's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

[Verse 3]
Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender)
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender)
But in my lonely room, I cry

When there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby

Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown)
Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown)

Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five

[Chorus]
Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmm

[Verse 2]
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way


[Chorus]
Working nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
Nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

Turned on some music to start my day

I closed my eyes and I slipped away

Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together


[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, ""I only think of you""
And it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)
(We belong together)

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(We belong together) (Who will?)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?)
Come back, baby, please

'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)

[Strophe 1]
Mann, ist das ein heißes Ding
Wie sieben Zoll von der Mittagssonne entfernt
Nun, ich höre dich flüstern und die Worte schmelzen jeden
Aber du bleibst so cool
Mein Püppchen, meine spanische Harlem Mona Lisa
Du bist mein Sinn für Sinn, der Schritt in meinem Groove, ja

[Pre-Refrain]
Und wenn du sagst: „Dieses Leben ist nicht gut genug“
Würde ich alles geben, um dich zu hebеn
Ich könnte mein Lebеn ändern, um besser zu deiner Stimmung zu passen
Denn du bist so sanft

[Refrain]
Und es ist wie der Ozean im Mondschein
Nun, es ist genau wie das Gefühl, das ich von dir bekomme
Du hast die Art von Liebe, die so sanft sein kann, ja
Gib mir dein Herz, mach es wahr oder sonst vergiss es einfach

[Strophe 2]
Nun, ich sage dir eines
Wenn du gehen würdest, wär's eine weinende Schande
In jedem Atemzug und jedem Wort
Höre ich deinen Namen, der mich ruft
Aus dem Barrio hörst du meinen Rhythmus in deinem Radio
Du fühlst, wie sich die Welt so sanft und langsam dreht
Dreht dich im Kreis und im Kreis


[Pre-Refrain]
Und wenn du sagst: „Dieses Leben ist nicht gut genug“
Würde ich alles geben, um dich zu heben
Ich könnte mein Leben ändern, um besser zu deiner Stimmung zu passen
Denn du bist so sanft

And if I had an aeroplane, I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train, but the boss is already there

Of all of my nights, why did my lover have to pick
Last night to get down? (Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon, honey, let's go make some noise"" (I can't resist)
Time, it goes so fast (When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday (Ooh-oh)

There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing, or maybe we just stopped trying

You say that you are so helpless, too
That you don't know what to do

Each night I pray
There will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way, too
And I wonder what
It is I feel for you

I will never let you down
When you need me
I'll be around
And darling, you'll always be

Do you believe in magic, in a young girl's heart?
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryin' tell a stranger 'bout-a rock 'n' roll

[Verse 2]
If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tappin', and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until mornin', 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah, do you believe in magic? yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock 'n' roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free

Can I make it any more obvious?

Secretly, she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
And they had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy, she said, ""See you later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
I see the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?

And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill
And all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet
Oh, yee-ow, you can't catch me
A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Jamie Foxx (Traducción al Español) Lyrics[Letra de ""Kanye West - Gold Digger ft. Jamie Foxx (Traducción al Español)""]

[Intro: Jamie Foxx and Kanye West]
Ella toma mi dinero cuando estoy en necesidad
Sí, ella es una trivial amiga de hecho
Oh, ella es una cazafortunas
Que camina sobre la ciudad que cava en mí
(Uh)

[Coro: Kanye West & Jamie Foxx]
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres

[Refrán: Kanye West & Jamie Foxx]
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

[Verso 1: Kanye West]
Cutie la bomba, la conocí en un salón de belleza
Con un pequeño Louis Vuitton debajo del brazo
Ella dijo: ""Puedo decirte roca, puedo decirlo por tu encanto
Tan lejos como chicas, tienes un rebaño
Puedo decirlo por tu encanto y tu brazo""
Pero estoy buscando a la elegida, ¿La has visto?
Mi psíquica me dijo que tendría un culo como el de Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez; cuatro hijos
¿Y tengo que llevarme todos esos traseros malos a ShowBiz?
Okay, busca a tus hijos, pero luego ellos tienen a sus amigos
Paré en el Benz, todos se levantaron
Todos fuimos a cenar y luego tuve que pagar
Si estás follando con esta chica, será mejor que te paguen
¿Sabes por qué? Se necesita demasiado para tocarla
Por lo que escuché, ella consiguió un bebé de Busta
Mi mejor amiga dijo que solía follar con Usher
No me importa lo que ninguno de ustedes diga, todavía la amo


[Coro: Kanye West & Jamie Foxx]
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres

[Refrán: Kanye West & Jamie Foxx]
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

[Verso 2: Kanye West]
18 años, 18 años
Ella tiene a uno de tus hijos, te atrapó durante 18 años
Sé que alguien está pagando la manutención de los hijos de uno de sus hijos
El coche y la casa de su mamá son más grandes que ella
Lo verás en la televisión cualquier domingo
Gana el Super Bowl y conduce un Hyundai
Se suponía que iba a comprar tu pequeño Tyco con tu dinero
Ella fue al doctor, se hizo liposucción con tu dinero
Ella camina luciendo como Michael con tu dinero
Debería haberlo asegurado, Geico por tu dinero
Si no eres un punk
Mucho, ""¡Queremos prenupcial! ¡Queremos prenupcial!"" (¡Sí!)
Es algo que necesitas tener
Porque cuando te deje el culo, se irá con la mitad
18 años, 18 años
¿Y en el decimoctavo cumpleaños, descubrió que no era suyo?


[Coro: Kanye West & Jamie Foxx]
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres

[Refrán: Kanye West & Jamie Foxx]
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

[Verso 3: Kanye West]
Ahora, no estoy diciendo que seas un cazafortunas, tienes necesidades
No quieres que un tipo fume, pero no puede comprar marihuana
Salen a comer, no puede pagar, no pueden irse
Hay platos en la parte de atrás, tiene que arremangarse
Pero mientras todos ustedes lavan, mírenlo
Él va a llegar a un Benz con ese Datsun
Tiene esa ambición, nena, mira sus ojos
Esta semana está fregando pisos, la próxima semana son las papas fritas
Así que quédate a su lado
Sé que hay tipos bailando, y sí, eso es bueno
Y seguirán llamando e intentandolo, pero tú te quedas bien, chica
Y cuando suba, te dejará el culo por una chica blanca


[Refrán: Kanye West & Jamie Foxx]
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways

""Why won't you ever know
That I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?""

Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moved my lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, ""You're such a lucky guy""

Runnin' away with me

Ooh (Soon)
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you I (I, I) can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
Tell you, it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me


[Bridge]
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray
""Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me""
Or I will surely die, hmm
(Her love is) heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

(Just my imagination) Once again
Runnin' away with me, oh
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

I’ve never met her but I can't forget her

Hey there, baby

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say, ""You gotta stay hungry""
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, give me just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

[Verse 2]
The forces of evil and a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
Who's chokin' on the splinters


[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Get crazy with the cheese whiz)

Mmm, whoo, yeah, DJ!

[Verse 1]
Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
Ask the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras, sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours? (Gigolo)

I'll make a move, nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Yeah, Timmy
Tell it like it is!
Check out this DJ

[Verse 2]
So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style, get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race
Now you're looking at me to take her place

[Pre-Chorus]
Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in ever way?
No style rookie
You better watch, don't mess with me

No moneyman can win my love

So don't you get fresh with me

[Bridge]
Smokin', not cokin'
Get funky sax
Looking good, hangin' with the Wild Bunch
Looking good in a buffalo stance
Looking good when it comes to the crunch
Looking good's a state of mind
State of mind, don't look behind you
State of mind or you'll be dead
State of mind, may I remind you?
Bomb the Bass, rock this place!

[Interlude]
What is he like?
What's he like anyway?
Yo, man, what do you expect?
The guy's a gigolo, man
You know I mean?


[Chorus]
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a buffalo stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love, baby, not romance
I'll make a move, nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me
No moneyman can win my love

We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love, baby, not romance
I'll make a move, nothing left to chance

Water from my eyes, and you on my mind

Deeper into your soul

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

[Chorus]
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care 'bout anything but you


[Verse 2]
Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not reach a solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

[Chorus]
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care 'bout anything but you
(Anything but you)

Love me, love me

Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

[Verse 2]
Well, it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well, she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

[Pre-Chorus]
Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide


[Chorus]
That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

[Verse 3]
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said ""Thank you ladies, if you hear from him let us know,""

[Verse 4]
Well, the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

[Pre-Chorus]
So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause


[Chorus]
Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl

Gucci Mane (Русский перевод) Lyrics[Перевод песни Rae Sremmurd — «Black Beatles» ft. Gucci Mane]

[Интро: Swae Lee & Gucci Mane]
Чёрные Beatles в городе
Немедленно вернулись в город, чтобы забрать бабки
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
Я отправлял цветы, но ты сказала, что ты их не получила
Но ты сказала, что они тебе не нужны (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

[Припев: Swae Lee]
Эта девочка реально любима многими (О, е)
Мир тесен, все её друзья знают меня (Знают меня)
Молодой пацан живет как старикан (А)
Быстро выпускаю деньги, смотрю, как они медленно падают (Медленно)
Тусовщицы всё ещё пытаются свести счёты (Свести счеты)
Хейтеры злятся по любому поводу (Е, е)
Дым в воздухе, пьянка в разгаре (Оу, оу)
Они без ума, когда диджей роняет иглу (Помни)

[Куплет 1: Swae Lee]
Накуриваюсь так, что не моргаю
О чём я вообще думал?
Новый день, новые бабки
Здесь нечего объяснять
Я ёбаный чёрный Beatle, кремовые сиденья в Ригале
Ношу очки, как у Леннона, люблю смотреть на эти раздвинутые ноги
Взял сучку в клуб и дал ей потанцевать на столе
Кричит: «Все тут — знаменитости!»
Трачу все без напряга
И делаю еще
Найди себе того, кто может и то, и то
Чёрные Beatles заставляют малышек делать танец живота
Она думает, что любит меня, я думаю, она врет


[Припев: Swae Lee]
Эта девочка реально любима многими
Мир тесен, все ее друзья знают меня
Молодой пацан живет как старикан
Быстро выпускаю деньги, смотрю, как они медленно падают (Медленно)
Тусовщицы всё ещё пытаются свести счёты (Свести счеты)
Хейтеры злятся по любому поводу (Е, е)
Дым в воздухе, пьянка в разгаре (Оу, оу)
Они без ума, когда диджей роняет иглу (Помни)

[Куплет 2: Gucci Mane]
Вошел с двумя девочками, похожи на стрипух в своей обычной одежде
Нищая шлюха может только показать мне, где богатая шлюха
Азиатка с зелеными волосами, реально странная
Чёрный парень, жёлтая Ламбо, еду на красный свет
Они увидели, что это Guwop зашел через черный ход
Здесь столько денег на полу, что мы покупаем одежду их детям
Зачем ты принес счетчик денег в клуб?
Пинт лина, фунт травы и килограмм порошка
Я прохожу евростепом мимо хейтера, как Рондо
Я переселяю твою тёлку в квартиру
Как Чапо, толкаю кокос белым
Черный Beatle, клуб закрывается, когда я скажу

[Припев: Swae Lee]
Эта девочка реально любима многими
Мир тесен, все её друзья знают меня
Молодой пацан живет как старикан
Быстро выпускаю деньги, смотрю, как они медленно падают (Медленно)

Дым в воздухе, пьянка в разгаре (Оу, оу)
Они без ума, когда диджей роняет иглу (Помни)


[Куплет 3: Slim Jxmmi]
Она хорошо соблазняет, и мы курим косяк
Твое тело как произведение искусства, детка
Не связывайся со мной, я разобью тебе сердце, детка
D&G на мне, у меня крутой стиль
1500 на моих ногах, я хочу убить этих хейтеров
У нищего меня были хейтеры, я богат, до сих пор есть хейтеры
У нищего меня были шлюхи, я богат, я до сих пор игрок
Я ношу кожанки Гуччи, будто сейчас до сих пор 80-е
Я дул OG Kush, я слегка под кайфом
Я не могу волноваться из-за нищего нигги или хейтера
Черный Beatle, сука, мы с Полом Маккартни — родственники

[Припев: Swae Lee]
Эта девочка реально любима многими
Мир тесен, все её друзья знают меня

Быстро выпускаю деньги, смотрю, как они медленно падают (Медленно)

A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend

Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament (I been there)
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn (Philly, Penn)
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in ('Cause it's in)
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans (Europeans)
Fake nails done by Koreans

Yuh, a win-win, come again
A win-win, come again (Yeah, yeah)
My friend, come again

Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing (Yuh, yum)

The second verse is dedicated to the men (The men)
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women

Class!
Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this—you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(She poetic)
She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?"

Well, he walked up to me and he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice and so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright and then he kissed me

[Verse 2]
Each time I saw him I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know that he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered, ""I love you""
And he said that he loved me too and then he kissed me

[Bridge]
He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
He kissed me In a way that I want to be kissed forever more

[Verse 3]
I knew that he was mine so I gave him all the love that I had
And one day, he took me home to meet his mom and his dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried and then he kissed me

Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried and then he kissed me

The bigger the order, the more guns we brung out
Run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody burn out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth, I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, your ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? (Who?), some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

[Verse 1]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love


[Bridge]
Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I'll find
A real love

[Verse 3]
So I've tried my best and prayed to God he'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

[Bridge]
See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I'm searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found


[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter, listen to me

[Chorus: T-Boz & All]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation, but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place, y'all don't hear me


[Chorus: T-Boz & All, Chilli]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray?
I pray all ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you


[Chorus: T-Boz & All, Chilli]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (I know, I know, your way, hey)
But I think you're moving too fast"

Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Uh, it wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
[Bridge: Rikrok]
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin', it makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost
That's why I sing


[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me"

I gotta get out now while I still can
While I'm still in the clear
The dream is done, it's over now
Gotta get me out of here

[CLYDE]
Don't say that, we're both in shock
We need to think this through
It ain't my fault, I had no choice
Nothin' I could do

[BONNIE]
With that bullet, you shot him and you shot me
Clyde, how stupid can you be?

[CLYDE]
It's too late to turn the clock back
I would do it if I could
We can talk 'bout this forever
But it still won't do no good

I wouldn't hurt you for the world, babe
But we'll get through this somehow

[BONNIE]
I'll get through this 'cause I'm leavin'
Not too late to turn back now


Thought I'd sign with MGM
I won't see that dream die

[CLYDE]
I don't give a damn 'bout MGM
And don't you say goodbye
How can you think of leavin'?
Get those thoughts out of your head
You ain't goin' nowhere

[BONNIE]
Clyde, I meant what I said

[CLYDE]
You come here right now
Show me that Bonnie smile
Babe, I need to see that smile

It's too late to say I'm sorry
It's too late for all of that
We cannot change what has happened
Let's face what we're lookin' at

You've got ev'ry right to be mad
But let's move on anyhow
We were born to be together
It's too late to turn back–


[BONNIE]
My mistake is loving you
Even if I walked away
My heart won't let me get far

I would die without you, Clyde

[CLYDE]
I would die without you, babe

[BONNIE & CLYDE]
Now look how alive we are

It's too late to turn the clock back
It's too late for all of that
It's too late to beg forgiveness
Let's face what we're lookin' at

[BONNIE]
I knew I would make the headlines
But I wasn't sure just how

[BONNIE & CLYDE]
Feel our journey has just started
It's too late–


[CLYDE]
It's too late to turn back now
It's too late–

[BONNIE]
It's too late to turn back now

It's too late to turn back now
It's too late–

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make somethin'
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
When mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
I quit school and that's what I did


[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
[Chorus]
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
[Chorus]
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone


[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on drivin'

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

[Outro]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way"

Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

[Verse 1]
You took me from the shelter of my Mother
I had never known or love any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

[Verse 2]
I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

[Chorus]
Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were just here, here with me

Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'd walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

All that's left is a band of gold"

I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
But Mama said

No, you just have to wait""

It's a game of give and take"" (Can't wait)

No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes""

But how many heartaches
Must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again?
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, is almost gone
I remember Mama said


[Chorus]
""(You can't hurry love)
No, you just have to wait""
She said, ""Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"" (Can't wait)
How long must I wait? (Ooh, until that day)
How much more can I take
Before loneliness (Love don't come easy)
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

[Verse 2]
No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on
These precious words
Keeps me hangin' on
I remember Mama said

No, you just have to wait""

It's a game of give and take"" (Can't wait)

No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight

[Chorus]
I keep waiting (Can't wait, ooh, until that day)
I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)
It ain't easy, but Mama said
""You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)
No, you just have to wait""
She said, ""Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)

Vieram a falhar agora, falhar agora
Veja, eu estou fazendo o que eu posso, mas eu não posso, então você sabe

Nós deixamos essa balada inteira tonta
Por que a CIA quer nos vigiar?
São os colombianos e haitianos
Eu não sou culpado, isso é uma transição musical
Bo-bop-so-bop, nós não roubamos mais cordas

Little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jackie gon' be a football star
Diane's debutante backseat of Jackie's car

[Verse 2]
Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jackie's lap, he's got his hands between her knees
Jackie say, ""Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks, let me do what I please""

[Chorus]
Say uh, oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Say, oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
They walk on

[Verse 3]
Jackie sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
""Well then, there Diane, we oughta run off to the city""
Diane says, ""Baby, you ain't missin' a thing""

[Chorus]
But Jacky say uh, ""Oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone""
Oh, yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

So let it rock, let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul
Holdin' on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon, make us women and men

Oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh, yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

(Background chatter)
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo
Shabada lo lo lo, whoa
(This is how we do it!)
Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid

[Pre-Chorus]
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say


[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

[Verse 2]
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway

[Pre-Chorus]
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)


[Verse 3]
Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6' 8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

[Chorus]
Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

[Outro]
Oh, it's party time! (This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the West Side (This is how we do it)
OG's got the flavor, yeah (This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
C'mon now, Def Jam, you know what it is (This is how we do it)


[Spoken Interlude]
Yo Montell, this Percy, man

I was a little too tall, could've used a few pounds
Tight pants, points, hardly renowned
She was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own, sittin' way up high
[Verse 2]
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues

[Chorus]
Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime (Mmm)
In the sweet summertime

[Verse 3]
We weren't in love, oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley, or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me, but neither one cared
We were gettin' our share


[Chorus]
Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
Mmm, and it was summertime
Mmm, sweet summertime, summertime
[Bridge]
And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
Yeah, and we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

[Verse 4]
I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closin' in

I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore

I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
Been there, done that, messed around

I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt

Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass

[Verse 1]
You were the sweetest thing
That I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar, honey
If I can't have you
Since you abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass

[Chorus]
Walking on, walking on broken glass (Woohoo, yeah)
Walking on, walking on broken glass

[Verse 2]
The sun's still shining in the big blue sky
But it don't mean nothing to me
Oh-woah, let the rain come down
Let the wind blow through me
I'm living in an empty room
With all the windows smashed
And I've got so little left to lose
That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass


[Chorus]
Walking on, walking on broken glass (Woohoo)

[Bridge]
And if you're trying to cut me down
You know that I might bleed
'Cause if you're trying to cut me down
I know that you'll succeed
And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You're doing really well my dear

[Verse 3]
Now every one of us was made to suffer
Every one of us was made to weep
But we've been hurting one another
And now the pain has cut too deep
So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walking (don't let me keep on walking)
I can't keep on walking (keep on walking on)
Keep on walking on broken glass

I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me

But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there, Delilah, you be good, and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history
Like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's, ""Beep-beep,"" then I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck

Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up? Shit, I
Parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen

[Verse 2]
There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?


[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey
Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey

Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?
My homeroom, homeroom angel always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes no one could ever stain
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Years go by, I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between

[Chorus]
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold

My blood runs cold (Woo)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold

[Verse 2]
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Somethin' had a hold on me
When angel passed close by


[Pre-Chorus]
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters, too magical to touch
To see her in that négligée is really just too much

We'll take it to a motel room

Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind


[Verse 2: Eve, Stevie J]
They wanna bank up (Ooh), crank up, makes me dizzy (Ooh)
Shank up (Ooh), haters wanna come after me (Ooh)
You ain't a gangster (Ooh), prankster, too much TV (Ooh)
(Ooh) Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me (Ooh, ooh)
Now why you gritting your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, 16's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani & Stevie J]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

[Verse 3: Eve]
Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, Glock shots from your stash spot
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah, nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh
Backtrack, make that, E-V-E
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe, I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
""Damn, she much thinner"", nah, now I'm complete (Uh-huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on


[Chorus: Gwen Stefani & Stevie J]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he' got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my, head they keep falling

But there's one thing I know
The blues he sends to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me
Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'

Letimo prvom klasom, gore na nebu
Otvaramo šampanjac
Živim svoj život u brzoj traci
I neću se promeniti zbog glamura
I sjaja, sjaja (Jesi spremna?)
Glamura
Glamura, glamura
Zbog glamura
I sjaja, sjaja
Glamura
Glamura, glamura
Zbog glamura
I sjaja, sjaja


[Stih 1: Fergie]
Nosim zlatne i dijamantske prstenove
Sve te stvari ne znače ništa
Pratioci i limuzine
Kupovina skupih stvari
Pojavljujem se na filmskim ekranima
Časopisima i buržujskim scenama
Nisam čista, nisam besprekorna
Nisam kraljica, nisam mašina
I dalje idem u ""Taco Bell""
Drive-through, sasvim opušteno
Nije me briga, i dalje sam stvarna
Bez obzira koliko ploča prodam
Posle nastupa, posle Gremija
Volim da se opustim sa porodicom
Pijem i prisećam se
Dana kada sam imala Mustang
I sada sam

[Refren: Fergie & Polow Da Don]
U prvoj klasi, gore na nebu
Otvaram šampanjac
Živim svoj život u brzoj traci
I neću se promeniti zbog glamura

Glamura
Glamura, glamura
Zbog glamura
I sjaja, sjaja
Glamura
Glamura, glamura
Zbog glamura
I sjaja, sjaja


[Stih 2: Ludacris & Fergie]
Govorim o željama za šampanjcem, snovima o kavijaru
Zaslužuješ samo najbolje stvari
Sada ceo svet nema pojma šta da radi sa nama
Imam dovoljno para u banci za oboje
Plus, moram imati dovoljno para da podržim tvoju opsesiju cipelama
Život tako bogat i slavan, Robin Lič bi bio ljubomoran
Pola miliona za kamenje
Putovanja odavde do Rima
Dakle, ako nemaš para, onda beži kući

[Prelaz: Fergie]
Imam probleme do ovde, imam ljude u ušima
Koji mi govore te lude stvari koje ne želim da znam (Jebite se svi)
Imam pare u banci, i stvarno bih želela da zahvalim
Svim fanovima, želela bih da vam se zahvalim, hvala vam, stvarno
Jer se sećam  dana kada sam sanjala o tome
Kako ću nastupati  na MTV-u, to bi bilo stvarno kul
Dovraga, put je bio dug i industrija je hladna
Drago mi je da mi je tata rekao, dao je savet ćerki

Todas estas joyas no sirven de nada cuando está tan oscuro
Es mi parte favorita, miramos las luces, llegaron tan lejos
Fue demasiado rápido, no pudimos alcanzarlo con nuestros brazos
Muñeca en muñeca, una conexión de encantos, sí
Acostado, seguimos siendo una conexión aparte
Es como si pudiéramos morir aquí todos jóvenes
Como si pudiéramos teñirnos el pelo de rubio
Si pudiéramos ver en veinte gemelos
Dos veces pudimos verlo hasta el final

Miro mis diamantes mientras salgo de mi nave espacial
Necesitas tu información, tomate unas vacaciones a Malasia (Información)
Tú eres mi chica, los paparazzi se están volviendo locos
Se tragó la botella mientras yo me sentaba y fumaba el helado
Camino en mi mansión, veinte mil en la pintura, Picasso
Las perras se sumergen, se tocan con negros como un nacho
Se quitó las panties, los diamantes bailan como Rick Ricardo
Ella lo tiene, fue a la universidad, trabajó en su licenciatura
Sé que tienes un pasado, tengo un pasado, eso está por detrás de nosotros
Promedio, haré un millón en promedio (M)
Estoy manejando sin cerebro, perra, estoy fuera de sí (Skrr)

Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road, I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

One, two
One, two, three, uh!

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

[Chorus]
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

[Verse 2]
Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and, uh, we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said, now, overcast days never turned me on
But something 'bout the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright, but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks


[Chorus]
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

[Verse 3]
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again, ooh
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause, baby, I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

[Chorus]
(Raspberry beret) Oh!
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second-hand store)
Oh, no, no
(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)
Aah!
I think I, I think I, I think I love her!
(Raspberry beret)
No, no, no
No, no, no (The kind you find)

[Verse 1: David Cassidy, (Shirley Jones)]
I'm sleeping
And right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up
From something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
Screaming out the words I dread
""I think I love you!""
(I think I love you)

[Verse 2: David Cassidy, (Shirley Jones)]
This morning
I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with
And so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself
And never talk about it
And didn't I go and shout it
When you walked into my room
""I think I love you!""

I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of

I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
That I've never felt this way

You really don't have to worry

[Hook: Rihanna]
Arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten
Er sagte, ich muss
Arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten, arbeiten
Er sieht, wie ich mich
Schmutzig, schmutzig, schmutzig, schmutzig, schmutzig, schmutzig mache
Also stecke ich besser mehr

Wann wirst du es
Lernen, lernen, lernen, lernen, lernen?
Es ist mir egal, wenn er
Leid, leid, leid, leid, leidet

[Part 1: Rihanna]
Langweilig! ... Ich werde ihn verlassen
Keine Lust mehr, wenn du nur rumlungerst
Er wird so tun, als ob es ihm nicht gefalle
Du weißt, ich war immer gut zu dir
Keiner fasst mich an, du hast kein Recht dazu
Bruder, schreib mir nicht in einer Krise
Ich glaubte an all deine Träume, Verliebtheit
Du nahmst mein Herz und meine Schlüssel und meine Geduld
Du nahmst mein Herz auf der Zunge als Dekoration
Du hast meine Liebe für dich mit einer Stiftung verwechselt
Alles, was ich von dir wollte, war, dass du mir etwas gibst
Was ich noch nie hatte
Was du noch nie gesehen hast
Was du nie warst
Mmmmm!
Aber ich wache auf und tu' so, als wäre nichts falsch
Einfach nur fertig machen für's...

Bevor sich das Blatt wendet, wendet, wendet, wendet, wendet, wendet

[Part 2: Rihanna]
Ich flehe dich um etwas an
Bitte, Baby, geh nicht!
Lass mich nicht hier auf der Straße sitzen, uh huh
Wenn ich eine neue Chance bekomme
Werde ich dich niemals, nein, niemals vernachlässigen
Ich meine, wer bin ich denn, dir deine Vergangenheit übel zu nehmen?
Ich hoffe nur, es kommt bei dir an
Ich hoffe, dass du es verstehst
Ich hoffe, dass du siehst, dass es wahr ist
Was soll ich sagen?
Bitte erkenne, dass ich es versuche, Babe!
Ich muss

Ja, okay
Du musst fertig werden, werden, werden, werden mit der Arbeit, komm rüber
Wir müssen nur etwas langsamer machen
Gib es an niemanden ab
Große Entfernung, ich brauche dich
Wenn ich Potenzial sehe, dann muss ich nur durchhalten
Hättest du einen Zwilling, würd ich trotzdem dich wählen
Ich möchte nichts überstürzen, wenn es zu früh ist
Aber ich weiß, du musst dich fertig machen, machen, machen, machen
Wenn du rüber kommst
Sorry, wenn ich nicht mehr so freundlich bin
Es gibt Leute, die mich fertig machen wollen
Ich habe dir heute Nacht all meine Gefühle ausgeschüttet, es tut mir Leid
Ins Rollen, Rollen, Rollen, Rollen, Rollen
Wie viele Shots noch, bis du ins Rollen kommst?
Wir brauchen nur ein Vieraugengespräch
Du könntest die Zeit und den Ort auswählen
Du warst einige Zeit weg
Jetzt musst du zuvorkommen und mir alles geben von der

Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know


[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

'Cause the next time that he cheats

I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But Big Punisher still got what you're lookin' for
For my thug niggas, for my thug niggas (Don't wanna be, don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Who's down to fuck tonight?

[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Ayo, I'm still not a player, but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, hah, see you later
I'm gone, penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In-house beach, French comtesse, 10 thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Coppin' a 5 or Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PAs and wearin' PJs
Now we reached the peakage, runnin' trains for three days
Who wanna ride? It won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm thick, huh? I'll rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up, chula, I'm all about gettin' loot
But I'll knock that boot if you out to get koofed

But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
I love 'em butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
Now lay your head on my chest and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin, I don't care
'Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks cum


[Bridge: Big Pun & Joe]
Up in the hot tub poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love, got you screamin', ""Punish me!""
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like, ""Don't stop, get it, get it""
Up in the hot tub poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love, got you screamin', ""Punish me!""
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like, ""Don't stop, get it, get it""

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you, you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time

[Verse 2]
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything, darlin', then and there


[Pre-Chorus]
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind and darlin'

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do

[Bridge]
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time

Oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
And maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay
If I could reach the stars"

Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like Cocoa Puffs
Sippin' Bud', gettin' perved and gettin' dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans faintin' while I'm entertainin'
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
Plus I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I'm Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer

Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slammin' niggas like Onyx

Trife niggas who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga (Hot shit)
Ice, niggas, all over, close to never sober
From broke to havin' brokers, my price-range is Rover
Now I'm knockin' like Jehovah; let me in now, let me in now
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now
Spend now, I got money to lend my friends now
We in now, candy Benz, Kenwood and 10's now
I win now (Woo), fuckin' lesbian twins now
Seein' now, through the pen I make my ends now


[Chorus]
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
(Come on)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now"
