Do you need some time all alone? Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone? I know it's hard to keep an open heart When even friends seem out to harm you But if you could heal a broken heart Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah Sometimes, I need some time on my own Sometimes, I need some time all alone Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone? And when your fears subside And shadows still remain, ooh yeah I know that you can love me When there's no one left to blame So, never mind the darkness We still can find a way 'Cause nothin' lasts forever Even cold November rain (You're not the only one, you're not the only one) Don't ya think that you need somebody? Don't ya think that you need someone? Everybody needs somebody You're not the only one, you're not the only one Don't ya think that you need somebody? Don't ya think that you need someone? Everybody needs somebody You're not the only one, you're not the only one Don't ya think that you need somebody? Don't ya think that you need someone?

And did you know Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? Oh And as we wind on down the road Our shadows taller than our soul There walks a lady we all know Who shines white light and wants to show How everything still turns to gold And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last When all are one, and one is all, yeah To be a rock and not to roll And she's buying a stairway to Heaven"

""Yeah?"" ""Is that Charlie?"" ""Yeah"" ""Hello, Charlie"" *phone hangs up* ""Great"""

Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" Now, for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lenin read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and fallin' fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume While sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised Him everything I could give If only He would make the music live And He promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die"""

Yo, I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which one'll swerve first Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth 'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either Shit, me neither We ain't eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle I breathe ether in three lethal amounts While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh) Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain (He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 'Cause I serve any stranger with money I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt Hello? (Billy?) Ayo, whats up? (We're comin' to get you) Stop, they know it's us I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh) I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh) Well, I'm out now (Shit) And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe 'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel (We'll be waiting) See you in Hell (Uh-huh) Wall Street (Yup), Royce Da 5'9"", Slim Shady (Uh) See you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye) Bad Meets Evil, what? (Until next time) And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil Two of the most wanted individuals in the county Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens It's too bad they had to go out the way they did Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon But their spirits still live on 'til this day Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?"

Im way smart I went to Kmart and stole a go-kart, went up the Flow chart. When the show start, I cause a ruckus With rhymes Long like Island from Nassau or to Suffolks I stuff chicks like tough dicks caught in the mix, I depict A dizzy flow to leave you seasick, youll flee quick If I Ruled the world, my first to free would be Rick. Ayyo, my Rhymes is mad fat, my mics bulemic, your styles anemic My scenic visions cycle like the one in prisms My rhymes is larger than any tiny microorganisms Metaphor has risen over the top. I kick the Ancient bebop, Pump like a Reebok, see through more eyes Than a peacock. Ill leave you as the laughingstock, Im gassing Flocks of emcees who blasting Glocks in their rhyme.

Don't try to adapt because I'm just too swift (How swift?) I'm so swift, and that's an actual fact I'm like Zorro, I mark a E in your back I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords The only weapon is my rappin' sword Intimidate MC's with the tone of my vocal throne When I'm pushin' on the microphone 'Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker The one who likes to max and relax And when it's time, issue dig-em-smacks I keep their hands clappin', fingers snappin', feet tappin' When it's time to roll, Uzi patrol is packin' PMD the mic's my only friend And through the course of the party, I kill again and again So if you're thinkin' 'bout battlin', you better come prepared Come with your shield and your armor geared You gots to chill!

Sometimes I wonder if its all worth my while Xzibit stay versatile with million dollar lifestyle And I could feel it as a child growing up The niggas that was real and the niggas that was scared as fuck That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you So ease off the trigger-talk, you aint killin' shit Its not affecting me or the niggas that I'm chillin' with I dont believe the hype or buy wolf tickets Nigga, you make a gang of noise and never seen, like a cricket I guess thats why we never kick it A lot of niggas is soft and get tossed, tryna fuck with the Likwit How many niggas do you know like this? Always claimin' that they ridin', but they really turned bitch It dont make sense, either youre a soldier from the start Or an actor with a record deal tryna play the partlike that! Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!) Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!) Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!) Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!) See, I dont need no lights, no cameras just action, goddamn it Never no superstar, I'm more like a planet So my composure is kept, while others start to sweat Emergin' from the fog with my fucked-up dialogue Tryna live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt And niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck And thats deep how deep? Its deeper than Atlantis Home of the scandalous, big bad Los Angeles Dangerous, vandalous; yo, not to be trusted So, how the fuck is you hard, not being scarred by the boulevard? I'm pullin' that card, and saying ""Gin, motherfucker!"" Flowin' like liquid soak it in, motherfucker! I'm breakin' it down, my sound surrounds like death From the West, puttin' whole counties to the test Its all in perspective, breaker 1-9 copy This is for the niggas gettin' caught up in the paparazzi Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!) Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!) Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!) Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!) Niggas smoke stress and crossdress, but I just play the back Others going through schemes and pipe dreams for a contract Real tightly rolled, fuck em all how I feel I made a cool half mill' before I had a record deal Therefore you look and stare like its magic But too much of anything can make you an addict When devils be startin' static, break out the automatic I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate But wait! Who dares to cross this path? Yo, I do you like math, cut with glass, make a bloodbath So on behalf of all niggas I get drunk with, smokin' blunts with I dispose of your punk shit He-he, and keep it all in perspective Carbon copies gettin' caught up in the paparazzi Once again, it's the Likwidation crew And we return at you like this Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!) Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!) Its a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)

Dance With The Devil - Immortal Technique,rap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qggxTtnKTMo,Dance With The Devil Immortal Technique,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William His primary concern was makin' a million Bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams A corrupted young mind at the age of 13 Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder He started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects He was fascinated by material objects But he understood money never bought respect He built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal I don't project my insecurities on other people He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles And so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed Dancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed But he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed Everyone tryna be trife, never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot So Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew Startin' fights over little shit up on the block Stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock Workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine Fulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain Tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same He wanted to be major, like the cut throats and the thugs But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love They told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die Standin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes Billy realized that these men were well-guarded And they wanted to test him before business started Suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted So now he had a choice between goin' back to his life Or makin' money with made men up in the cyph' His dreams about cars and ice made him agree A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three Everyone tryna be trife, never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin' Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone Three in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home And so they quietly got out the car and followed her Walkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor ""This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw"" So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground Screamin', ""Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!"" The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin' They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin' Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently And then they all proceeded to rape her violently Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn Rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned When they were done and she was layin' bloody, broken and bruised One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22 They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head I'm fallin' and I can't turn back I'm fallin' and I can't turn back Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice And he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter 'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother She looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her She cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate His corruption had successfully changed his fate And he remembered how his mom used to come home late Workin' hard for nothin', 'cause now what was he worth? He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth And cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared But only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it After that, they killed his mother and never spoke about it And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true 'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows And every street cypher, listening to little thugs flow He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked White, brown, yellow and blackcolor is not restricted You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever Oh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh? But it's not You didn't count on a fallen angel gettin' back into the grace of God and comin' after you Y'all niggas ain't shit, your producers ain't shit, your fuckin' A&R ain't shit I'll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker's head off! Go 'head and grip Glocks, I'll snap your trigger finger in six spots You'll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots I'll watch you topple flat, put away your rings and holla back Can't freestyle; you're screwed off the top, like bottle caps Beneath the surface, I'm overheatin' your receiver circuits By unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches What you preach is worthless, your worship defeat the purpose Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service Beyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm Tour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend's dick In the meantime, you can French-kiss this clenched fist Diabolica one-man brigade spreading cancer plague Fist-fuckin' a pussy's face, holdin' a hand grenade So, if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you're less than nothin' I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction You motherfuckers are nothing, you cannot harm me I'll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army Storm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I'm on a mission To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms Immortal Technique'll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch You're faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix I'm 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily I'm like time itselfI'm gonna kill you inevitably Chemically bomb you, fuck usin' a chrome piece I'm Illmatic, you won't make it home, like Jerome's niece I'll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology So you're nothin', like diversity without equality And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven Produces more digits than twenty-two divided by seven You're like Kevin Spaceyyour style is usually suspect You never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin' thug yet Your mind is empty and spacious Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist Face it, you're too basic, you're never gonna make it Like children walkin' through Antarctica butt-naked"

(Uh, bye...) She keeps on passin' me by! (But nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passin' me by! (Yes she does...) (But nevertheless, I'll say it again that) She keeps on pass When I dream of fairy tales, I think of me and Shelly See, she's my type of hype, and I can't stand when brothers tell me That I should quit chasin' and look for something better But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her I just play love by the ear and hope she gets the picture I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger She could be my broad, and I could be her (And I could be her...) All I could do was stare Back as kids, we used to kiss when we played Truth Or Dare Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer To get in her book, and it looks rather dry I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop the stride 'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop She told me ""Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop"" She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand By letting her pass, I'd prove to be a better man She keeps on passin' me by!

Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence From a distance, I desired her, secretly admired her Wired her a letter, to get her, and it went: ""My dear, my dear, my dear You do not know me, but I know you very well Now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I feel for you When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp 'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so And if I was your man, then I would be true The only lying I would do is in the bed with you"" Then I signed: ""Sincerely The one who loves you dearly P.S. Love Me Tender"" But the letter came back three days later: ""Return to Sender"" Damn... She keeps on passin' me by! She keeps on passin' me by!
